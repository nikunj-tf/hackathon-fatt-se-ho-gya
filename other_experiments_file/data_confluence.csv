#,"# Founder’s CheckIn  ### **Questions for Discussion** amongst founders    * _How will you describe the culture at your company?_    *  _What are your core values?_    *  _What are some rituals, processes or best practices which help you reinforce/live/improve your culture?_    *  _What are some challenges/questions you are grappling with around building a better culture?_    *  _What do the above mean for offline, remote or hybrid teams?_  ###  **Resources for Running, Building Culture and defining values**  #### Here is a great session on building culture and engagement for remote teams by Nitesh Agrawal, CO Founder of Lets Dive from Surge 04: <https://links.surgeahead.com/NtNvipXQF6Gj3CnU9>    * There are many more questions to use as prompts here for building the culture : <https://www.notion.so/surgehead/Culture-Mission-Values-1836486a30244a4b80e34598751bd4ad#5941f98ff47e4d26b250d55a1cafb1f7>    * **The defining of values should be bottom up and should be done with everyone on the call via zoom/townHall etc.** Meesho had done this across 200 team members over a series of OffSite session - the biggest agenda is the Values and the Vision Piece       * Some more prompts, will add them to Notion: Ask yourself “What clues can you gather by looking at your organization as an outsider?” Imagine you are an anthropologist encountering your organization in the wild for the first time. Use the worksheet to document what seems to be particular to the people in this organization. Who appear to be their heroes and legends? What sayings do you hear? What customs and rituals do you observe? What artefacts do they hold as having great importance?      * Questions Virtual Internships use for Culture, by their value: <https://www.notion.so/surgehead/Interviewing-for-Culture-Fit-6ad95971973a49f380b6b381af5f990a>  ### **Pointers on Culture by other Founders**    * **Anuraag** : Transparent, People are open seeking for help and also given feedback     * **Jann** : Want to learn a bit more about Remote. Different offices have different sort of culture - bogota office seems to be on the younger side => challenges around Remote       * Designed a document based on the Questions given to the team       * In the interview, it becomes difficult to maintain the discipline when everything goes good but the last thing is not in line. That is something we have not been able to maintain yet       * **CELEBRATE** small successes in the team: One person is getting a fridge and we are celebrating that. **Concept of Wall of Wins**    *  **Fatima** : Every meeting notes from meeting shared in a thread, no matter who is in the call (Accountability is top-down); We have also created a bot that shares what progress is there for the platform for Discord ==> **High Impact is Meeting minutes channel**      * Did a 5 hours exercise on Values with the Core team and other key members       * After that exercise, we have a better understanding of our teammates => What are the core values we stand up for.       * Picked up 20 values and then shortlisted 5 without which we cannot survive. Where could we compromise, where we cannot? ==>They have made it publicly available on their Website in their careers page       * Interesting stories came in: Eg - **the pivot that happened in 1 week** .The last question on stories from organisation       * Everyone’s calendar is open with other team members   ![](https://truefoundry.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/44138507/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-25%20at%2012.59.21%20PM.png?version=1&modificationDate=1661403583970&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=680&height=310)    * **Suvrat** : 6 person engineering team and check-in takes 1 hour daily, which is a challenge       * Doing a detailed culture exercise tomorrow with the broad team     * **Marc** ( **UnRavel Carbon** )      * We started with Daily Stand-ups and have been through several iterations => Went from daily to three times a week to now once a week - This is more information sharing rather than stand-up. I feel a bit bad for the team as this keeps on changing for the team each time.       * For the team in Vietnam, it could feel quite remote       * One thing conscious of: As we grow, how do we maintain the culture       * Have put it in the agenda for upcoming Off-site     * **Viren** : During the hiring process, do we specifically screen for people who have the similar values?      * We didn’t define it well yet, so we haven’t necessarily done it best   ________________________________________________________________________________________________  ## Finding PMF - Prachi Pawar and Anandmoyroy Choudhary  ### **What does PMF mean for different businesses?**    * **Suvrat** : Someone who has run a POC and have tried is once is willing to try it for a longer term period     * **Rishabhjit** : In attentive - Segment that is better understood. **Demo to Conversion** rate is high.     * **Neehar from PraTech** : B2C product - very different compared to other companies (What was PMF was tissora?)     * Customer Love and Customer access.How well you solve the problem for a customer, at a lower cost and at a larger scale?  ![](https://truefoundry.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/44138507/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-25%20at%201.59.02%20PM.png?version=1&modificationDate=1661407159173&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=680&height=381)    *  **ROY** : PMF should be measured for a **Hair on Fire** Persona       * **Eg** \- Suvrat's phone does not stop ringing. Every CMO in India wants to meet him      * Even if you hand out a brick who could reduce the fire by brief, it would be great       * If you are able to build a loop where there is well defined ROI that is there and take a percentage of fees => that is the point when you have PMF         * Who signs the cheque till the money comes into your account - until that is figured out in the enterprise company, it is not going to work       * **LTV to CAC** : Huge customer love but the LTV to CAC was 1.5 => Won’t work as it doesn’t make sense from a ROI perspective. Basically if you lose money on every order, most customers will love your product, but you don't have PMF. This is why unit economics matter a lot in a transaction business    *  **If I make short term choices now, will it hurt my longer term ability?**      * You don’t win that ability to scale unless you win the point right now. Even AirBnB is an example.       * Reality of life is if you understand your persona well that they can adopt and create value for them => that allows them to expand and do more       * **MVP** : Another problem is sometimes people don’t complete the workflow. Whatever is of value should close the loop for the customer. **CLOSE THE LOOP**.       * **Create a very niche definition** and don’t fear that you are locking yourself out of 20 other things. The reality is until you win in an early space, you will anyways not be able to scale     * **ICP Personas for different Companies**      * <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KZv8RLHvmu-84020hILeKiTOgd6V2EyCyDg6rupZ-yM/edit#gid=0>      * Enterprise companies make a mistake of not closing the loop in terms of value/ROI    *  **Axes of Measuring PMF**      * Customer Love       * Metrics : Dollar and marketing metrics       * Scale     * Getting access to Lenny’s NewsLetter → Discount code for Lenny's newsletter: <https://links.surgeahead.com/Rvbia885k9ujBqkw8>    * If you have to fund the purchase or usage of the Product, you don’t have PMF     * **Notes** : The input to LTV is retention rate % - so you would want to estimate if x% is coming back with y AOV - this could be the LTV. But you also should have an idea of what frequency of usage is for your product  ![](https://truefoundry.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/44138507/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-25%20at%202.46.22%20PM.png?version=1&modificationDate=1661410008173&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=680&height=369)  ![](https://truefoundry.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/44138507/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-25%20at%202.47.31%20PM.png?version=1&modificationDate=1661410070481&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=680&height=324)   **Example of a Company that is defining its metrics across 3 axes -**  ![](https://truefoundry.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/44138507/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-25%20at%202.50.55%20PM.png?version=1&modificationDate=1661410275561&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=680&height=334)![](https://truefoundry.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/44138507/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-25%20at%202.57.31%20PM.png?version=1&modificationDate=1661410668141&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=680&height=331)  ###  **PMF Metrics**    * <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KZv8RLHvmu-84020hILeKiTOgd6V2EyCyDg6rupZ-yM/edit#gid=776536940>    * **Airalo and Scaler** : Very iterative PMF journeys     * Try to be default alive if nothing is working atleast   ________________________________________________________________________________________________  ## AMA: Gaurav Sharma [[ _https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaufire/_](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaufire/&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1661848318124398&usg=AOvVaw21OmFnJ6yLVkYu1LcJSt2E)], CEO of SaaS Labs [[ _https://www.saaslabs.co/_](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.saaslabs.co/&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1661848318124398&usg=AOvVaw3l4lq-u511vTbCI029Z94r)] in conversation with Tejeshwi Sharma: Talking about journey to PMF    *  **Saas Labs** \- Hubspot for Sales and Customer Support team     * BootStrapped; Only 2 institutional rounds later     * **PMF** : You don’t need a lot of money to reach Product Market Fit       * Money is not the bottleneck in getting to PMF     * Created one mistake in the 1st Product: Not charging enough for your product     * To create a big business, you have to be a champion of a Job Profile. Eg - Adobe is a champion of Designers    *  **PMF** : No matter whoever you hire, you still feel things are broken. Demand was higher than supply. SUCKING sound from the market     * Product and story matters a lot ! Product inside looks the same. **Emerging markets** \- bias for value. In bigger markets, pricing is a signal of quality.      * Just the wrapper of pricing changed and boom, we hit the inflection point       * Product is the last touch point for customer. **Perception and Distribution** is more important in early days => Will I lose my job etc. We should do 95% on Positioning, Selling etc. Writing code is the easiest part of the whole game.     * **Run ADS on Facebook and other channels** \- which were getting higher CTR etc. Know your channels which work.     * Few things: Super annoyed is better then indifferent. Either get to **Super annoyed or Super Happy**.       * Complains are okay - People are engaging with product - that’s good and not bad       * If people are not saying anything, that is bad.     * **Biggest Metric I tried** : $ per employee - 100K$ per employee revenue and 50% profit. Even today, we are at 80K $ per employee.       * **Metrics for tracking** : See leading and lagging indicators.       * **Another Product thing** : More feature requests and less bug reports as you start growing     * **Engineers** should be close to the Customers     * When creating a category, you will have to do a lot of education of customers. There is an extra threshold of energy required.     * **Don’t see what others are doing but see what is the competitive advantage you have**      * Eg: First few years, we used just Customer Support as the competitive advantage     * **Q:** How did you build the culture of experimentation and giving in to Serendipity.     * **Consistent Messaging**      * We are building something great       * Small small wins celebrations       * Celebrate and drink      * Become personal       * It cannot happen transactionally       * Consider it as a SIP investment     * **Monthly Townhall**      * Not in a boring manner, but in a nice manner - Repeat the values, culture and principles     * We trust you from Day 1 => We give the best ownership. The coaching you do for early folks - they will pass it down. **Don’t sound like a broken record**. Storytelling is everything, give fun examples.     * **Good Reading Books**      *  **Built to Sell** \- John Warrilow      *  **Netflix book on Culture** \- For reading on culture       * **Monetizing Innovation**    *  **Hires in US**      * Marketing, Product Marketing and Partnerships - we are hiring in US.         * We closed leadership roles and then they hire under them       * We hired an agency in US to get an agency to help you to see if initial basics work"
