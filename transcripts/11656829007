The interesting career journey person went to Flipkart, spent four years there and then decided to join SAP. Don't understand why. I think you might have missed it. Yeah, but I think also it'd be nice if you can just prepare a few changes that we will make in our approach until that, call Hannah so we can at least take a few of his suggestions. Some suggestions are very good in the users and all. And the good news is by the other users are already segmented. By the 600 user? Yes. 600 users. Are you already segmented, Kagalwali? User. Users segmented already. So we'll have a decent ideology so we can at least split them into two parts. And then one of the things that we can try to do is you can either think of it as top of funnel, bottom of funnel, one of cheese. You can also think of them as like very technical versus leader type of segmentation as well. The psyche engineers, Kaggle data scientists for the type of and high level, you know what I mean? Right, that can also be a segmentation. Think a little bit about a couple of ideas and then we can brainstorm. And if you want to make that meeting like 1 hour long thaki, we can brainstorm more. So if we can do it AJWALA blog case, we finish and then after that spending on this time may not be possible. Can we push it to tomorrow or day after? You can do that. How are you placed on weekends? Fully available, obviously weekends randomly that will reschedule, but otherwise, like abbey in general, like the next few weeks I have nothing planned. Like I'm just working, that's it. And we should try and meet for either badminton or squash games. Yes, you are pro at squash. If I'm one at badminton that you have already seen like one on ten at badminton, I probably am 2.5 at squash. That's what I mean to say. Badminton I have not played before. That's it. So usually in Bangladesh, squash quotes are limited. That's why society is made at we'll definitely plan that. I think he'll not be joining his already six minutes. I think it's okay to also let people be. I'll give it to you. Also, I needed a time with you. I wanted to discuss on the next steps for lockum. Not next steps, but messaging. Do you have time like parchment? Like the last time we discussed, we said six go touch base. GPU, you. Split it. Let's start with you, get you on board on the platform. So let's spend a couple of days just doing that. Get you familiarize with the platform. You can play around with the platform, like basically take it for a spin, basically. And then Bill will work together with you on the GPUs, like provisioning GPUs, start with whole GPUs and then get to fractional GPUs. Makes sense. Take it. Automate. Three step planner, basically pala step is just like allowing him to spin up the platform and then doing whole GPUs and then doing fraction GPUs. First week we keep for you on boarding with the platform. Second week you get whole GPUs. Third week you get fractional GPUs. But are we on time for that? Yeah, this plan would work. I think this also looks neat. It also looks like we are organized. I think a week by week plan organized people also have a good sense of what is coming. It works out very well. I think I'll drop an email on that. Okey dokie, boy. Or we'll also initiate our education series, Katie series, once you are a little bit most. So what's your plan for. A few weeks but end up just the minimum? Probably longer. And what's your plan after that? You wanted to stay Katient somewhere as well? I think one of the things that I've realized is basically it works out for people who are doing like a nine to five job. Basically, I actually don't have any block where I can go and enjoy it a little bit. Generally, whenever you do stations, you don't have the full convenience. Also it turns up becoming worse of. Both words, working space. So you end up paying more, you are more uncomfortable and you don't end up enjoying. In my schedule, I think that's one thing that I'm realizing. I would rather take like three days off, just go somewhere, enjoy and come back. Actually, we can do a truefoundry hiking session sometime. Those who are interested, I think let's plan it for actually I was planning like hamarajo working space. I was planning a food walk session. There are areas in Banglar wherein you work till eight, nine and then let's go together and hop on street foods like 1234 and then go back home. We'll also plan it for like Friday night we work and maybe late night we leave, arrive at early morning somewhere and then hike from there. Maybe some. So you can count me in on any initiative that brings more people together. I generally very much into the while I am in Bangalore, I'm practically going to come to office a minimum of three days per week. Likely four days per week. Probably five days per week. Okay, so you take my card in that case? Yes. Only meetings will deter me from coming to office. If we can get more people, that's would be nice. Cool. I'll plan team outings around that. Okay, bye bye. Okay, bye.
