Should we mail them? Yeah did already. Hello? I can't hear you. Yeah, I'm saying I mailed him already. Okay kendrick. Hello kendrick. Meanwhile Chinmay, can you quickly share a couple of questions that you are asking on the monitoring thesis dockingba board rest or the domain directly to you or in the dock, whatever. Okay, I think I'll tag you on the group then I'll just ask a few of you. What is the current way? What is the current way? What is the change that we will bring sikh MATLAB what is the change in their life that we'll bring with our product or what is the value that we're seeing? Sure. But I didn't understand that part. I think, Joe, you will notice that this one part where I mentioned like a small line on problem ticket key architecture basically log. People would keep retraining models even if it's not necessary or people would just not retrain. Assuming the data is not drifted but the data has drifted basically take care of housing use case how frequently should we retrain the model? And how far back in the time that we should consider the data? When we are retraining the model generally bow issue, right? So I think that's one problem that we are trying to solve for them. And the second idea is basically just generally detecting your model degradation basically, right? Any type of model performance regression that is happening you figure that out essentially at different types of status quo. Like one type of company would basically just with some period like with some manual effort that is one type of company like your actual user performance gets affected because needless to say at some point you will drop off tree training it et cetera. Some people act more on the conservative side and they would just frequently retrain TKA may retrain. So that would be the second thing, right? And the third thing is generally if you think about the overall model performance monitoring most of the companies set up an engaging statement like model performance is like you do like an offline evaluation and online joy model performance real time there's usually no performance tracking statement just. Go out of performance. Then you get a feedback from end user, then you update go and update it something like that. QA or whatever. Basically. Their use case which is like the first one for their trying go fraud detection. I think they said for them this is super important because usme they can't afford drift. It's important other drift to us. So maybe we can think exact console target what is the characteristic, what kind of people would be most affected by this? Maybe ICP around also we can define a few things is a target segment exactly concert company sales translate this is a qualitative thing but how will this translate to the people that we. That'S a good point here. On an average, let's say the statement is blanket statement generally consumer focused companies my data drift is generated also faster whereas just capacity like just large enterprises, it's just pure b to be used on an average, I think. You are true, but it's obviously not, like a true statement. But I think you're right. When we do the reach outs, we should think a little bit about which type of segment would be affected more with this thing. I'll try to make with my understanding and put in the use this. I try to add on a few stuff on this and then tag you on edit it. Also, by the way, wherever you think there's more things that can be added here. Just edit it directly in the dock. Also with the company, the more better we can make this thing. And then other coach Orb which either that you feel like are missing that we should add. We can add that and then this will become like a template of our thesis building. These things so should be answered. Key why now? What's your key insight? How will you differentiate which is the exact customer persona that you're trying to target but at least this will become like a nice template help and obviously this person is not joining I think we can drop off now bye.
