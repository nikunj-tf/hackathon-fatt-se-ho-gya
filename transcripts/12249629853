Hey punit. Hi. Hey, buick. How are you? I'm doing well, thank you. I have with me and rog on the call. I'm not able to see you. Is it like the video? Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out this whole thing is different and we use like teams and not this meat thing. This is some sort of wrapper around the team, right? It looks like this is the meat wrapper around the teams. No, this is themes only. Who is it different. Okay. Nonetheless, I think there are a couple of other colleagues who are trying to join and I'm not sure if probably you need to allow them to join. Sure. Do you have the invite link? Yes, I just forwarded them. I've just forwarded them and he's saying that can you join? Let me ask him. I think you chatted with him while he was in abhisheki. Very sorry. It's been like very long time and I wanted to talk to you guys, but then sometimes things just go crazy. Ma'Am, I can totally understand. It's not a problem. Yeah, just give me one more minute. Let me just get my team here. Who will be probably main audience for you. He says unable to join. Can we do that? Let's see if it is team. Can I ask anyone to join? I'm not sure. How do we do this? You want to create your own link and we can join that? Yes, let's do that. Okay, give me two minutes. I'll send this link to everyone and then it will be okay. Thank you. Hey shiva. Yeah. Hi vivik. I think we will be waiting for you and at that time we thought you are not able to join. So punit is creating a separate link from your enterprise account and probably he will be sharing it with us and will join on that link. Sure. Even also I joined through my mobile app instead of this laptop. I understand it could be some sort of a complication on in terms of the plan that we use. No worries. We'll be joining his link that he's ready. Okay, sure. Thank you.
