Hi. Good morning. Hi. Good morning. Hi. How are you doing? I'm good, how are you doing? I'm doing. Join in a bit. Okay. Sorry, Debug will just join in a bit. Sure, yeah. Can you see in the video? Fine. I'm sorry, you were saying something? Yeah. Is the network fine? Yeah, it is. Okay, cool. Hello. Is Deep up joining. A couple of minutes? Finishing up. He's just joining in a bit. Okay, no problem. Just quickly, like, you will look after. Which part of so I'm secretary to Mr. Deepak Sharma. Okay, got it. One point contact for all digital you can say. Okay. And other things as well. Thanks. Great to meet you, Ajana. Thanks for helping and coordinating and setting up this meeting. I really appreciate and have a happy New Year. You too. You too. Thank you so much. I really apologize. It's been going back and forth from our end as well because people had a few things which were very urgent to be scheduled and it was just not happening. No worries. I think it's I'm glad this is happening now. Yeah. Question, does he have back to back calls? Is there a potential to exceed the call by a certain minute there or like. Actually, no. But you know what, maybe you can have this as a small intro meeting and then at length, you may ask him for another time slot. Another time slot? Okay, sounds good. I just wanted to confirm that. Yes. And in case if you have something to put up, you can do a screen sharing. I'll just have a brief chat and maybe then I'll share my screen if need be. Narcina. Is anyone else joining the card? No. Okay. It's just him. Got it. Hi, sorry, my apologies for joining late. No, it is. Hi, how are you? Very happy. Yeah, I'm good. How about you all wishing you happy? I wish you a very happy New Year. Yeah. Happy New Year to you too. Yeah. How are you doing? I'm good. How about you? We're doing great. We're doing great as well. Great. Good to connect here in the New year. Absolutely. So, Deepak, first of all, really appreciate you taking time to speak to us. What we wanted to do on this call was maybe brief you a little bit about us, like as a team and what we are planning to do and what we are building on the product side and the problem we are solving. And I know you lead the entire digital initiatives at Kotak, plus I was seeing that you also actually invest quite a bit. So curious to know about your journey. Like, do you also engage with startups in their journey as the investors, angel investors with them, or is it more like for the public markets? And then would love to hear about the digital initiatives that Kotak has been taking and how AI and ML has been shaping those initiatives and post this we would love to kind of do a more detailed follow up call where we can dive into more details of what we are building as well. I hope that is okay. Yeah, I'm sure happy to answer the questions that you would like to hear from us, but yes, I do invest, but very selectively. Okay. I do meet since a lot of interesting startups. Just give me a minute please. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Sorry. You are mentioning that you do invest but very selectively. Yeah. So I do selective. I've got set of companies where because here at the end of it, I just don't invest. If I believe in some companies what they are doing and where I can spend time with the founders, helping them shape up what they are building, then I get that time. But not as an investor, just for writing the check and forgetting about it. That's not what got it cool. Just to give you a very high level introduction for True Foundry. So Vishik, me and Nikko, we were all batchmates from IIT Karakpur and 2009 to 2013. Batch and post that like we spent our careers in different organizations. I'll go into that when in 2020 we were all at the stage of our career where we wanted to build something ourselves and we left our jobs to kind of start building in the talent space, helping companies hire technically better talent through our platform. So we all moved from US to India, we built a company in the talent space, we faced some scalability challenges there and we ended up selling that to Info Edge after a year and a half. And during that phase of the journey, what we also realized is we were more interested on the tech side of things coming from tech backgrounds and we wanted to build something that could have an impact there. And AIML has been going through an inflection point, every business is getting affected by it. And we had seen platforms at Facebook that were really, really good. And when we came out and we were talking to companies and working with companies, what we realized is the AIML infrastructure outside is still very mature and way behind the top companies like Google and Facebook of the world. And we thought that if we can build what we had seen at Facebook and Google, we'd be able to kind of change the way AIML is perceived today. And with that vision in mind, we actually started building two Foundry around a little more than a year back. So last September. So the goal was that today if companies take a lot of time to get their machine learning models to real ROI, hopefully with our platform, we are able to reduce that time value and make organizations realize the value of their machine learning initiatives and AI initiatives or analytics initiatives, initiatives much faster. So we started like a year last September. We raised funding from some of the good investors like Sequoia in India, ENIAC in US and then a few angels like Naval Ravikan. And then we have been building the platform in this journey, like we have been working with some of the companies and leaders like you, like either chief data officers or heads of ML or chief analytics officer of different Fortune 500 companies as well. In the journey of knowing the problems, in some cases we have been working with their organizations to do pilots so that we can understand and build as per their requirements. And that was essentially the purpose of this call as well, to know more about quotas, data initiatives and so on as well. Just wanted to share a brief and I'll go into more details as well. Great. So just for clarification, I don't look at Data Piece, the firm, we have a separate team that looks at overall data initiative. But yes, I do consume a lot of outcomes that come out of that team into digital channels. Got it. But data science is a separate practice within quota. Got it. Understood. That is fair. If I may ask, like from a digital initiatives perspective, what are the different initiatives that Kotak has been investing in? And also from your consumption side when you consume the data. Have you been, like in your interaction with the other stakeholders, have you been seeing any things that you, as an organization would like to invest in or which you feel invested in, would make it even better, as compared to, say, even global counterparts or other companies that you might be seeing? So from data lens, if you ask me, digital is much worse. So if I get into digital, it's a topic in itself that can take us off of how we look at it because there's a transformation, there are platforms, there are channels, there are innovation and feature eddie tech initiatives, the modernization of different applications, changing, different front end design, customer journey. So. It'S massive for us. There are many things and virtually, if you ask me anything, that's today too it has a digital component built into it. But since your interest is more from data perspective, I would say that data is integral part of whatever we are building in digital beat in terms of our recommendation engines or persona based dashboards or bringing consumer insights on. Their spending or their saving behavior helping them nudge and meet their financial goals and outcomes. Finding what are the most relevant products and offers for customers. Now we are also working on aggregating external heldaway portfolio data of customers and then mining the data to bring a consolidated view of net worth and thereby the recommendations coming out of it. We are investing massively on the whole CDT piece. To see all kind of data, click data, behavioral data, transaction data, external data that is held away. How do we bring all of that in to create more value in terms of either recommendation engagement across digital channels. A lot of work happening on various customer moment of truth and touch points that we get either through social media or branches or contact center. But what customers are saying, complaining or responding about how do we use that to build a 360 profile of a customer and then go sharper about what are their behaviors and motivations and moment of misery and thereby use that as a basis too? There is a lot of work happening on data, on business, financial projections and forecasting tools where we look at propensity of a particular geolocation to generate a certain business for brand selection or depending on certain parameters, external environmental, what are the forecast on different business type, on deposits, on investments, on loan book? If you look at it, data is again prevalent everywhere and different teams are looking at generating outcomes out of various data stats and initiatives. So depending on whom you ask, they'll all have a set of products like credit risk, underwriting collection, forecasting. So pretty much I would say, just like digital is everywhere, data is everywhere. And then the teams are trying to figure out whether we have ability to bring data in at one place and then build our ML models where required or where simple just tools are required and depending on at what level do you need to get into to work on use cases? I think that some part we do with partners, but a lot of that gets done internally. We have a large team which focused. Are your voices breaking? There seems to be some lag in the network. Okay, I'm on the road, so quite possible that the network is fluctuating. So deepen. Just one follow on question. You said that you guys use some help of external vendors to make sense of data. We had seen that most of the team is comprised at Kotak in house of data scientists. So do you all work with other organizations? Like just throwing some names out like a quantum black fractal who's doing the ML work around it or all of this happens in house? Typically no, we do work and that's what I said. So there are projects, not that everything we do in house between what partners do and what we do. Got it. Two more questions. One thing is because data powers a lot of the digital initiatives and it also powers every other part of the organization, is there like a central data team that is there for each unit? There is like no, there is a central team. Central team. Okay, got it. The people in that team, they work with different business units. Okay. And the other question is, when we talk to a lot of organizations, what we find is they actually find it very difficult to measure the ROI from the central data team. So I wanted to understand as to how you do it at Kotak or has that been a challenge as of now or is that not really a point of worry as of now? Because finally the structure we started with central return, we realized central is not just the right way. So today the structure is more of I would say a federated structure where there is know how and skills are at central leave control. But then these teams are embedded within the business functions to work closely with them on use cases and create value. I see. Okay. And then for this initiatives to actually get into the hands of the user when they have to be actually put into the hands of the user, is there an infrastructure team that kind of pushes this model? Do you kind of use on Prem? Do you have a sense of whether you end up using on Prem or do you use any of the cloud vendors or kubernetes. So there is work happening on moving a lot of this to cloud. But right now most of our current data stack was all on Prem. Now we are gradually moving some of those onto the cloud depending on the use cases where we think that helps. But it's like a roadmap. So some part of it is on cloud. Now we are moving largely to AWS. A lot of our data stack. But then a lot of this is coming based on the whole event based architecture where we realize that what is relevant from a journey use case that we need to show to customers or probably use it for something which we cannot do with a lag. But a lot of stuff that comes on a T plus one basis we still don't see. There is a huge ROI of moving all that onto the cloud. The cloud is expensive. So the use cases are extremely important to decide what should that strategy be. So we'll continue to work on hybrid. If our question is more on that, it's not that it's going to be fully on cloud anytime soon because I think we just need to be convinced that there is a strong merit on moving everything to cloud. Plus most of our systems, our legacy systems continue to be on Prem. Hosting the system on Prem and only moving data to the cloud is something again, there needs to be a merit in doing all that. Fair? Understood. And one last question is do you see any challenges currently in this on the data side, even though you're not looking at the data directly, but in your interactions with how you are consuming data or how the different initiatives are consumed, is there any challenge either from a speed perspective or cost perspective or anything? No. I see. There are significant opportunity for us to scale up and become better. So I won't call it challenge, but I will say that expectations are far higher because most businesses are becoming data led business. You want to do a B testing, you want to take a choice on a design model everything is underlying basis is data. So as more and more products and businesses are getting aware of the power of data, the demand is far higher and I think that's where teams are picking and choosing and taking more control on what outcomes they want rather than just leaving it for data science team to deliver. Yes. Okay, fair enough. I think that is what we have also been seeing like every company now trying to use like the top state of the art techniques as you said, like even things like maybe testing a model that is being released versus another challenger model to see which one will be better and then rolling out into production in the right way. So it's great to know that the. Central data team's main responsibility will remain making sure data is available in a manner in which it can be consumed on the fly but not necessarily focus on building all use cases coming out of that. Because availability of data in terms of volume, velocity, velocity, that part will continue to be the role of central team but everything else on top of it will keep moving between partners, different teams, more team members internally are learning a lot of these capabilities because the whole cost of managing it on cloud is much easier. So I think we will continue to see that as an approach going forward. Got it. Perfect. Cool. Thanks a lot December. This is super helpful. What I'd love to do in the remaining part of the call is maybe if you have any questions for us, happy to answer that. Otherwise I'd love to tell you a little bit more about our journey in more detail and the problem. Sure, go ahead. Okay, I'll share my screen. Let me know. Do you have access to the screen? I know you are on the road but are you able to do no. I'm on my iPad so go ahead. I can do everything. I'll only just stop my video because bandwidth I don't want it to be showed. Okay, got it. Cool. So Deepak basically first wanted to share about the team. So as a team like we are right now, 15 member full time team plus additionally we have a few full time contractors and interns. So in total that is like a 24 member team a Vishak. Nikonj and myself, as I said, were batch mates from It Karakpur 2013. Batch Nikkunj worked, went to UC Berkeley, and then he worked at Facebook as a lead ML engineer in one of their teams called Portal, which is a competitive device to Alexa. And Avishek was at Facebook leading the software engineering and the infrastructure side of things there for almost, like, six years. I used to work with a hedge fund called World Fund. So you know more on the finance side. I used to do a lot of algorithmic trading and investment across different asset classes as a part of World Fund. So all three of us basically we together bring in the expertise of working and building large scale infrastructure systems at Facebook and Nikunjan Avishek, where Facebook has an internal developer platform. What it used to do is anything like, just like you said, like the central data team, they want to ensure that the availability of the data is there at a very fast speed and in a central place like a data lake probably where everyone can access it and use it for different use cases. So they had an internal platform wherein all the data could flow in with visibility to different teams with the right access controls. And from there it was very easy for any data science person to actually take build models and even test it out and then deploy it to production in a scalable way. The large part was obviously the availability of huge amounts of data, but also like enabling people who necessarily do not necessarily know engineering but are good at data science to be able to test this out and roll it out to different things. So a lot of that kind of system we have not seen in other places and we thought it would be good to kind of build it for the globe. And as I said, we ourselves were building entire, which is in the talent domain there. We were trying to ourselves build models for matching candidates and resume and we faced a challenge in terms of taking this to the real users. So all of this inspired us to kind of leave our jobs and actually start building. Truefoundry in this journey. Like we are backed by Sequoia and other players, but also a few angels from the CIO side, like actually the global CIO of Deutsche Bank. Dalib Khandelwal in his, you know him, he is one of the investors as well. And then we have tried to get people who have been CIOs or ML heads or data heads at different other companies in the journey. So the goal is to kind of understand from them, learn about their problems and work with them in solving some of the challenges as well. So yeah, our belief as a team deepak is that by 2030 every company will be an ML led company, no matter which domain it is. Any company that does not use machine learning and data science in the right way and in a speed in a fast way itself will probably lag behind its computers. And that is why a lot of companies are taking up this challenge to speed up on the data initiatives, invest in them and so on. And we want to be able to enable that by providing them a platform to speed this up. So if you look at the ML journey, what happens is there are two challenges. One is the data engineering site, which basically means collecting of the data and having all of that in one place. We are actually not solving for that. The second challenge remains around. Once this data is there in one place, the data science team has to take up different use cases, build models and actually then roll it out in a scalable way and reliable way to different users user group. So we actually play around that domain where our goal is that anything around the deployment of the machine learning models, we are able to make it fast. So current like it takes a lot of time for most companies to do it. We want to enable that to happen within one day. So suppose like there is data that is available then from there to model building to deployment should be like in one day. So you are able to actually see benefits of new data collected within one to two days, impacting your actual customers. That is there. So that is the zone we are building. I'll just stop here just to kind of see if from a problem perspective. Let'S go ahead because I think I just wanted to absorb what you are doing. Okay, I'll skip this. I think this is a workflow of the general data science initiatives where there's a data engineer whose role is to kind of collect the data and the data science. This is generally building out the model. So I think you are well aware of this. I'll skip this in this. Basically what happens is we have seen that big tech invests in the internal platform team to accelerate the time to value of these ML projects and they are able to see improvement in their overall process efficiency by 30% to 40% and they are able to see additional revenues being generated in the range of 10%. And that is exactly what we wanted to do for other companies. Internal platform teams generally are hard to build because they are a time consuming effort. A good platform that enables the Data science team might take more than a year to build for a team of like 1015 developers. And at the same time the current solutions that exist around the world generally are blackbox. So they do not provide the flexibility for the data science teams to actually customize it as per their needs that might be there. So actually we are trying to solve these two challenges by actually building an internal platform team equivalent through our platform. So you can think of a true Foundry platform as something that integrates with your general workflow and it democratizes the development of any machine learning model along with testing. So we have chosen like Kubernetes as one of the main go to players, on the top of which the platform has been built. It supports both on prem as well as cloud. So the hybrid model that you are talking of, it supports. And with that, what we try to do is we speed up the developer workflows while providing them the flexibility and while ensuring that there is full security and control for the infrastructure. You can think of the platform in a way that okay. If there is a data science person who is building out the model for them, it's very easy to deploy it in a way to be able to test it against real data or shadow data so that they can actually see if there is any benefit to using the portfolio. Then we make it very easy for the data science teams to actually learn and adapt to the platform by providing them independence and flexibility through Python, SDKs and other libraries that they might be generally aware of. At the same time, we ensure that the best practices from the infosec side is already there so that the overall infrastructure is stable, reliable and so on. And finally, along with this deployment, we also provide monitoring, which is like if you are taking a data science initiative, how much is the actual performance of this model? If there is any changes that are happening to the model, how is that happening? And so on, so that you can actually debug it and make your models better over a period of time. So the rest of the presentation will dive into more the platform details. But I'll just stop here deeper and see if there are any questions that you have. I think this is good. So what we can do as a follow up is I can get my team to spend some more time send me a shot deck which I'll ask them to go through. Yes. And we'll get them connect and see us do a little more detailed deep dive to see their specific areas of value to us. Yeah, I think that will be great. What we love to do is, when we connect with the team, we love to spend some time to understand, say, some of the use cases as well and how they have built their infrastructure, what is the general workflow. And based on that, I can actually present to them some of the things that might be potentially useful for their team. The goal is to learn and see if there is any small pilot also that we can do to actually add value to the team. That will be great from our side. That is one the second thing we book is I actually wanted to also see if this kind of the platform that we are building could be interesting for you from an investment perspective. And from an investment. We are not concerned about the money. Like, we have fairly good runway. But the goal is to have good leaders who can actually be a part of our journey where we can take help of their network, we can take help of their guidance as to how to build a really good global SaaS platform. So if anything around that is of interest, I'm happy to share materials around that as well. Yeah, do that. Send it to me. Let me keep this independent of what we can do at quota. So send me that. Should I send that on the same idea or you can send it on. That idea or I can give you my first thing Debug M. Sharma as it's in quota followed by 71. 71 at@gmail.com. 71 at@gmail.com. Okay, great. Thanks a lot, December. Thank you for taking out the time. That's why it's nice talking to both of you, I think. Wish you all the best. Thank you so much. I'll share both the email. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Bye.
