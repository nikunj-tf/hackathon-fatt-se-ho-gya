Hello. Hi, Shashank. Good afternoon. How are you? Good, how are you? I'm doing very well. Thanks a lot, Shashank, for taking the time. No worries. Pleasure to meet you. You're in Bangalore these days? Yes. I'm traveling to Bangalore for some time. Right now I happen to be in Hyderabad, but generally I'm in Bangalore for next few weeks. Sorry, go ahead. Where are you based otherwise? I'm based in San Francisco. Yeah. And here in Bangor. I'm staying with my friend and co founder Abhishek, who is in Indra Nagar. And you guys have a set up in Bangalore, is it? Yes, we do. We have an office in Kor Mangla. Okay. We take a rework space, basically. And a lot of our teammates are in Bangalore. A couple of them in Bombay, one in Paris and I'm San Francisco. What's the team size? There are 20 people now, out of which 15 are full time and five contractors part time, et cetera. Yeah. Okay. So you guys are across cities, basically, right. With center of mass being Bangalore. I sometimes find viewwork is of course a fancy place to work out. But I don't know what kind of cost is associated with each seat, actually. Yeah. So I think for our small office that we have taken it roughly cost us maybe in the range of, whatever, one lakh INR per month. Like 1015 seats we have gotten maybe roughly in the range of whatever like ten k per month per seat. Something in that range. I also don't think that's not too bad. I think usually what I heard about we were maybe you guys have taken a sort of bulk per se. Probably will be costly, right? I think per seat would be a little bit costly. Like, for example, right now I was traveling, they did something. I don't even know what did they do, but they got me like a temporary one month card and they charged me six k. Take whatever it is, it's fine. Which we work you work out in Bangor? Cor mangala. There's something called a WeWork prestige cube. That's where we work out of. Where do you live in Bangalore, Shashank? Nikunj stayed Sajapur road, actually. Sajapura, okay. My office is in Mg Road. Okay. So not too far. Basically, like, mostly I hear about both the places, Sarjapur and MJ Road. My Bangalore geography is not very good, but Saljabur and Mjirod both I have heard of. I think Oamangla would be somewhere in between, I would say. Yeah, nice. Tell me, how can I help? So I think, Shashank, the idea of this call was primarily to just introduce myself and True Foundry and learn a little bit about what you all are doing at HDFC Credilla in terms of relevant to this to the space that we are working in, which I will describe to you soon. And in terms of help, it would really depend on what kind of work that you all are doing. And then right now we are in the early stage of startup building and ideally we are trying to work with larger enterprises or market companies basically. So in that direction, any help that you can potentially lend offer, which is which could be introductions with right set of people, feedback on the product for this segment, what are the things that we should be careful about, what do we need to think about integrations and all? And potentially there's a use case at the Hdfccredila that would also be interesting to explore. So there's a bunch of different directions in which the conversation can go. But to begin with, I'm coming in the conversation with very open mind. We're just literally introducing ourselves and learning about you. Sure. So maybe I can give you a brief background about myself and a little bit about my co founders and then tell you something about True Foundry as well so that you have context. So first of all, like Ankur, I know him through our common investor Surge, right? So we work closely with, I don't know if you know folks at Surge, but we work closely with Rajan and all who have invested in Uncle's startup Bamboo Box as well. How do you know uncle, by the way? He's my Batchman. Okay. Very strong connection then. Nice. Yeah, we have been in Bangalore pretty much both of us have been in Bangalore for a long. Okay. So we keep meeting informally quite often. Nice, good. Take care. So a little bit about me shashank. So I went to Karakpur 2013. I graduated from there. That's where I met my now co founders and Rag and Abhishek as well. They are my batchmates and hallmates, so that's good. Have known each other for like almost 15 years now. After Karakpur, I went to the US for my masters, so I went to Berkeley and since then I've been working in the Bay Area in machine learning. So initially I joined a startup where we were building a lot of recommended systems for the e commerce industry. And post that I joined Facebook where I built a bunch of conversational AI systems. So that's primarily the background. At Triplexion I got a chance to build out a horizontal machine learning platform as well because we had like five teams that are building ML models and to support them operationally, we built out this horizontal platform at Facebook. Of course, I did not build this platform, but I used the platform and I was amazed by it because I think they have done like a phenomenal job at like operationalizing machine learning, increasing developer productivity. Basically. After I quit Facebook, I did one startup in the HR tech space, talent space, basically spent about a year building it, but realized that there were a lot of operational challenges with the startup. So we let that get acquired by InfoAge because although there were operational issues, we got like 40, 50 customers who are already working with us. So that way it made sense to have it acquired by Info Age and then move on to building something that can be scaled with tech. And that's how we got to True Foundry. And before I explain about Truefoundry, just a quick note about Abhishek and Unrag. So unrag comes from Fintech world. So he went and joined World Quant after undergrad and he operated out of their Mumbai, New York and Singapore offices. So there he took dual role like a portfolio management of roughly 600 million and also a member of CEO office. So he took care of a lot of strategic initiatives there. And he's also an angel investor himself. Whereas Abhishek joined Facebook immediately after undergrad. So he spent about six years at Facebook and he eventually led the entire videos.org before quitting Facebook to do the startup. You all are batchmates. All three of us are batchmates. We went our own routes after Undergrad but then met again in 2020 to build entire and then Proof founded together. Sure. Where are you from, Nicolas? I mean, if you don't mind, of course. I grew up in Calgada, born and brought up in Calgary, but originally my family is from Rajasthan, so Rajasthan maybe our Pavilion doll is close to Turu. That's where. So if any big function at home happens, we still go to Rajasthan and do some Puja and all. But generally my parents are in Calcutta. Okay. Anragh and Abhishek are abhishek is from a small town called Buddhud near Durgapur and Rag is from Jamtara. Have you heard of the TV series Famous Jamtara? Yeah. Now famous Jamtara. So that's where the three of us come from. Okay. Would love to learn a little bit about you as well, Shashank. I don't know if you know which. Year I I saw your LinkedIn. Yeah, I mean, yeah. So it's been long while, you know, a lot more gray hairs. Now we have Course batchmates 99 pass out from IV, Delhi and mostly I work with investment banks, capital markets sort of domain, right. This is the first time my exposure to lending. But yeah, fraud had been in BFSI and did a small stint of running my own fintech before taking up this role, which was essentially a robo advisory platform. And I think we ran it for around three and a half years and eventually figured it out. It's going nowhere. And that's when I think it was taken over by another firm called Script Box. And then I took this role all in all, as I said, in BFSI, but mostly capital markets. And right now the focus is really, I think, bringing in a lot of ticket option in the current organization. Right. And one advantage that I have here is that in the past, before I join, not enough investment has happened in the technology, which is good and bad, but good in the sense that we know there's a lot of learning out there and we don't have to reinvent the wheel so we can be a bit more intelligent in terms of how we are shaping up sort of the landscape for the organization. Right. So my focus is really of course in my current role I am responsible for engineering product as well as infrastructure. Oh nice. Yeah and I think that was one of my precondition of taking up a role of course not in that word but indirectly that is how I wanted to operate right. Because I really don't particularly in BFSR things are so disjointed right and decision making some becomes and also the right size right. As of now around 1000 employee organization across all functions and our technology right now engineering I would say we still very small footprint of in house engineering team. We are working with some of the niche product engineering firms who mostly work with startups, have expertise in building internet scale platform plus of course we have built a small product team we onboarded small product team in Bangalore, our offices in Mg Road as I said that's pretty much it right? As I said, journey is tedious. I kind of inherited interesting state trying to bring in a lot of change more than the in my opinion nikon's right. And I somehow with so many years of experience right and pardon me if I may sound probably with us but in my opinion technology has become a commodity actually. Yeah and we are not a technology company for that sometimes I think a lot of startups in my opinion the mistakes they're doing they're trying to set up everything in house right and it is not easy actually. Right. I think hiring people is just one aspect. Right. You really need to be ready to kind of deliver at scale. And I think that's the focus that we have. We are basically trying to take the right decisions, trying to build some of the core platform ourselves, trying to buy a lot of SaaS solutions and kind of use it for our needs and as much as possible, I don't want to build in house capabilities. Right. And not that I myself come from a strong build background having worked with Goldman for a long time where I think for some time I was actually part of their Bond Equities technology team which was essentially all models, et cetera, et cetera. Right. But here I think we're taking a hybrid approach and right now we are in the stage of building the foundation. I think a lot of innovation would actually follow. Right. So in terms of our exposure to AIML we've just started scratching the surface right, but I'm still trying to figure it out. Right. I think a lot of those things are happening in peripheral at the moment without very clear strategic direction. Some of our risk team is involved in building credit risk model, credit score model, et cetera, et cetera right. So that's one. So we work with somebody who come with statistical background. I think somebody who is password of Isai Calcutta and he runs a boutique consulting firm. So they have helped build some of the regression models for us. But I have no clue, honestly speaking, whether we have the right ML ops for that because that's not really a focus for me right now. I don't have the foundation ready. I'm definitely not thinking about the terrace garden. That's the state I am in. But definitely it's something which we've identified certain use cases where we would want to leverage the rich data that we have having been in the business for almost 15 years. And we are, I think one of the leading education loan providers in India. Right. And we have a loan book of upwards of 10,000 Kruger actually. So yes, I mean, definitely that's the focus. But we still have to figure it out how and what. Understood. Okay, thanks a lot for setting that background shashank. This is very helpful. I think I do have a bunch of follow up questions. Yeah. Actually I'll just start with the question. You mentioned that the overall team is about 1000 people. But the engineering footprint, in house engineering footprint is small. So roughly how many people are on the engineering front working within the team? We are around 50 member engineering team, not engineering the technology team. Right. Including product. Plus we are working with a lot of service providers actually. Right. I think for example, our cloud operations are not managed in house because I don't intend to have a DevOps team myself. So anything which is not a core sort of expertise. Right. So some of the core platform which are core to business, something we are building, but most of the other is size solutions actually. And in terms of the AIML landscape right now, sounds like the approach is that the entire model building, et cetera, is handled by some external third party team, basically. So again, that's one of the project that we did. Right. We don't really have something which is ongoing engagement, right, where we are churning out models. So we had a one off engagement, they built some models for us, they did test it and then we have been using that right now. Again, a lot of time has elapsed since they did that model. How do we evaluate that model, right? How do we reset that model? All those things we have not figured out, we might have to engage them again. But I mean, what I really want to understand right, because see, a lot of people talk about AIML model, right. I think I really want to figure it out what would be the right strategy. Building model is one thing where I don't know what kind of skill sets are required and I'm not talking about the technology skill sets. Right. Which is one aspect of it, right? Mostly. So maybe it'll be good to understand what are the areas that you guys work on? Surely. Let me give you a little bit of that background. Just one quick question. So, HDFC Credit is basically a subsidiary of Hdfca. It is a subsidiary of SDFC Limited. But we work independently now. Soon we will become subsidiary of SDFC Bank. As you may be aware that SDFC and SDFC Bank are merging. Right. Okay, I see. Okay, understood. But we work independent. Got it. Understood. Cool. Okay. So let me actually explain a little bit about what are we building shashank and why are we building as well? Where did the idea practically come from? So, one of the things that we realized is that the entire space of building machine learning models takes usually a very different approach compared to traditional software. Like, number one, it involves a lot of experimentation and prototyping. It's not deterministic, usually. Right. You're playing around a lot with your data, different types of models, et cetera, to figure out what works. The second thing, which I think, even after you have built out the model, the model does not stay like fresh. Right. You have to periodically retrain it because something can happen. Right. So there's a bunch of maintenance involved with machine learning by design of the system. Right. And then the act of productionizing, whatever that means, can involve a lot of steps beyond software, because now you're dealing with the data with which the model was trained, the artifacts, like the model artifact itself, and of course, the associated code as well, as opposed to just the code that happens in traditional software. Right. So it overall makes the entire pipeline very complicated, from your prototyping to deployment, to monitoring, essentially. Okay, so that's the problem that we are trying to solve that. Imagine a data scientist or an ML developer who's trying to build a model. Like, they could be using Jupiter notebooks to experiment with it. How do they quickly try out different models and figure out which one is actually working? Once they compare which model is actually the best, how do they quickly deploy that as an API endpoint so that it can be integrated in the product? Or just create a bunch of inferences that can be dumped to a database? Basically, just close that cycle. And number three, how do you monitor that your data is not drifting if you have fraud use cases? There's an adversarial nature of the model. Right. So people will keep coming up with new ways of coming up with fraud. I guess. So how do you detect that something in your data has changed, basically? So, like doing detecting the drift and closing the loop, that's the segment of ML model per se, that we focus on. Okay, now, the approach that we have taken to build this shashank is very similar to what we saw at Facebook and then what we heard from talking to a bunch of leaders outside of Facebook, right? What are the problems that you are facing? The constant resounding problem that we heard from outside was that people build out models but the business impact never comes. Like machine learning actually never delivers impact basically or really delivers it so late that it's like too little too late types thing. So how can we expedite this time to value from machine learning model is what we are focusing on as part of our platform. Okay? And the solution approach that we have taken is more of a platform approach that we saw at Facebook. That is, how do you build out all these tools in one platform that enables your ML developers to move really fast basically, right? Make it really hard for them to do the wrong things, make it really easy for them to do the right things, basically. If you have built out models, how do you track all of them so that you don't lose something? If you have made a prediction, how do you make sure it's actually reproducible? Like if somebody asks you that why did you make this prediction? You're able to explain that this is exactly how it has happened. If you are making a prediction, it's always logged so you can create visibility dashboards for your leadership. All these good practices are taken care of by design of the platform, basically. So that's the approach that we are taking to solve this overall problem. Now in this journey we are fairly early. We are working with a few enterprises, like for example in India we are working with Reliance, we are working with a couple of other startups like SaaS startups, real estate startups. In the US we are also working with a couple of pretty large enterprises like $50 billion plus enterprises like Synopsis and all that working with us. Now, working here does not necessarily mean that here's a platform you get what you see. Basically, working at this stage of our startup actually means working in a design partner relationship that we have already built out this platform but you may have more requirements on top of it. So we'll work closely with your team and make sure that you get the value out of what we are building, basically. So we actually like right now though, we are so small that even as founders we continuously engage with our current customers and just work with them to understand their requirements and actually build out the product accordingly. So that's the overall set up where we are. I'll take a pause here to see if you have any questions on the product approach stage, anything? Not at this moment. Okay. Is it fairly clear about the way we are trying to solve the problem, Shisha? I mean, of course I would like to understand a little bit more detail, but what I want to understand is where exactly the how to define the boundaries of what your platform provides. Visa vis the ML developer. Right? Yeah. I think that boundary is actually fairly. Clear in my head. So I can help you quickly define that. So basically, the playing around with the data, knowing the domain knowledge, like, let's say I'm building a credit model, I'm building a fraud detection model, I'm building some other regression models. All those the domain knowledge falls within the scope of the ML developer. Okay. Which algorithm to use. They can select themselves so it's within their scope which features to use. It falls within their scope. Anything related to, like, infrastructure that okay. Like, how do I quickly try out these 15 models without learning five different infra technologies? Basically, that's the part where they would hand off to us, basically. So we, as a platform, meet them in their comfort zone, which usually is like a Jupiter notebook. So they are working off of a Jupiter notebook, but we quickly give them infrastructure where they can run their models. We give them tools where they can compare their models. We give them tools where they can deploy their models. So that's where we come in. So if you think about the development, like lifecycle from left to right, data feature engineering, model building, model deployment, model monitoring. Right. So we actually come at the model stage. So not in data and feature engineering stage. We come at the model stage. What model to build falls within the scope of developer. Where to run and train these models falls within the scope of proof. Truefoundry deployment of monitoring is something that. Do they build the models using the tools that you guys provide or they just use the usual, I think, open source tool? Yeah, so they can do both. So the way our platform works is, if you have your favorite library that you want to use, or you want to build something custom, you actually write whatever arbitrary Python code and you'll be able to build your models using that. If we already have integrations with most of the popular libraries and frameworks that we directly provide within the platform as well. So if you wanted to use that, you could use that. Okay, got it. So that's practically the boundary of where we come in now. Yeah. Any other questions. Where this platform is available? Right. I had quickly checked the website, and you guys mentioned you work with most of the sort of cloud provider. So how does that work, actually? Right. Because as you would have already realized, especially the science of AIML model is essentially dealing with the proprietary data. Right. And this is one area we would never be comfortable going outside of our cloud. Actually. Yes. This is like one of the most common things that we hear generally in the space shashank, so that is taken care of by design. So Truefoundry is available in two different modes. One is what we call as a public cloud mode, where you can try out the platform, get the developer experience field with publicly available data sets, right. Not use any of your proprietary data. And then like when you are actually ready to start using Truefoundry, that's when you get to a private cloud mode. Now basically what happens is Truefoundry has an entire platform gets deployed on your cloud so your data never leaves your cloud. Everything operates within your VPC, your model training, model deployment, model monitoring, including True Foundry's UI, everything gets deployed on your cloud. And actually that's the mode in which all of our customers are currently using us because it's dealing with PII data sensitive data and nobody wants to send out their data to us. So that's how the platform is actually designed. Perfect. And on that note, we actually work with all the major cloud providers and on premise as well, basically. Okay, got it. We are on AWS. Okay. We also started off with AWS. As you can imagine, most startups actually just start off with AWS, right? Yes. One other question is you mentioned that your DevOps, you don't have internal teams. How does the infrastructure management today works? Shashank, we have managed service provider who manages all our cloud operations actually. Okay, understood. So if anything that's new that is needed to build out, et cetera, they will basically take up the project essentially. I mean from infrastructure perspective. Right, got it. Makes sense. They provide 24 by seven support for cloud and also if there's a need of any infrastructure provisioning of new servers. So we just basically place a request to them, they manage it. I want to make sure that this part is clear that in this call my goal was not to not necessarily to make sure that suddenly HDFC creditler starts working with Troop Truefoundry from day one. No, it's okay. I've been found of myself. Right. So I really appreciate I think definitely I also had interest to know about what you guys are doing and always good to meet folks who are doing interesting stuff. Right, and we'll be happy to meet over interestingly. What has happened is we have a couple of interns who have joined and we are thinking of sort of picking up some of the AIML project. Okay, I just need to speak with my VP engineering and I'll just mention it to him about you guys and see if there's any at least if we can just explore as you said, we can check out what is available on your public cloud and see if anything can be of use to us. That makes sense. Yeah, we can always explore that. There are a couple of other things that I wanted to bring up. Shashank is number one. Is. Recently, we have been onboarding or working with a few leaders in the space technology leaders, data leaders in the space who have joined us as angels in this journey. And they Have Been Very helpful through the journey and also hopefully we do well as a startup so it also becomes a good financial outcome for them as well. So that's the other place where I thought that I don't know if you have an angel investing yourself or you're generally interested in that, but if that's something that could be interesting, I'm happy to share more details with you and potentially that could be one potential way of engagement as well. Okay, I will think about it. I don't myself, having run my own investment right now quite insulated from that world philosophically, I think it just gives me a lot of peace of mind to not worry about a lot of things actually makes sense if it comes to my mind. If there are others who may be, I would definitely connect. And then the third thing is I would just generally and by the way, to me everything is like I'm really not trying to make this transaction at all. We just come, that's why it's definitely a pleasure to meet you. As I said. Right, it's always good to be people and definitely that's not something which is on my mind. Also, I think it's been a good conversation so far. Yeah. So while I'm here in Bangalore Shank, I would love to meet you in person once because once I'm gone back, there's less opportunity to meet. So probably if you are available sometime next week, I could drop by either closer to home, closer to work, whatever. Works best for you, probably. I think closer to work would be good. I usually go Monday, Wednesday and Friday I would work. So you just let me know next week? Next week is what? The first week? Right, just let me know. Ping me maybe a day or two in advance if you're sort of going that side. Drop by Mg Road is anyway, good place to hang around. Perfect. Yeah, I'll actually shoot for Monday next week but I'll update you once I think we are connected already on WhatsApp so I'll follow up there and try to set something up there on Monday. Sounds good, sounds good. Thanks a lot, Shashan. Great catch. All right, have a great day. Bye.
