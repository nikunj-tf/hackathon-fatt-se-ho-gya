Hello. Good morning. How do you pronounce your name? Ojas. Ojas. Hey. Hi, Ojas. Hello. Nice to meet you both. I'm sorry about the mess up from the last time when we were supposed to be travel master. I'm glad we are talking now. No worries at all. No worries at all. Thanks a lot for taking the time. Ojas, where are you based? Somewhere in Texas? Yes. Whereabouts? In the Dallas area. In the Dallas area. Okay, nice. And do you travel to the Bay Area frequently? Yes. As needed. A few times a month. It's only been less than two months that I've joined, so I've been there four times in the two months. So I guess twice a month is the current frequency. Yeah, I think it's frequent enough. I think it would qualify as frequent, yeah. Nice. Are you able to hear me correctly? Okay. All right, good. I just wanted to ensure that we can. All right. I'm really keen. I tried to look you guys up a little bit, and I'm like, this sounds interesting. I think gourmet forwarded that also. So I'm really looking forward to understanding what's your let's get into that. I'm super keen. Sure. So I think what might be helpful in today's call is that we do a quick round of introduction between the three of us. We explain you a little bit about what we are building at True Foundry. And I know that you have joined Gap recently, so you probably are not already familiar with all the systems internally, but we would at least love to know the charter of your role. Like, which areas do you intend to focus on? How will your general association in this data and machine learning domain look like? And then from there, we can define some of the next steps for our next call. Is that okay? Absolutely. And just one more context. Like, the reason we reached out, actually, to Goodneath was he basically belongs to the same set of institute that we come from. He studied at Ayat kanpur and we actually studied at IIT Karappur. So as we were building, we were looking out for leaders in this space, and that's how we got connected. So it's a pleasure to connect. Absolutely. He's very connected to the It al in. Obviously, a lot of innovation, startups entrepreneurship happens from IIT album, so we do get a few of those connections. I've worked with Gourmet for over six, seven years now in various roles in various organizations. So this is the third time that we are working together now. It's only been two months, but again, needless to say, I'm very used to his way of working and love following him around. He's an amazing video. Oh, that's very nice to know. So a little bit about Lucy. I'm here two months now. The role is VP of Enterprise Data. Right. What does that mean? Essentially ownership of all data engineering, data operations, machine learning, engineering, machine learning operations, support to the data science community, enabling the data science community, marketing technology, customer data, customer data platforms. What else? False with me, the product side of things, right. The data as a product, we're going to operationalize products, end to end products, using data as the key driver. That's kind of my charter. Very similar to what I've done in the past, right? One of the big things, what we work together and I work together was at 711. So 711, my role kind of grew towards that. It didn't start as that, but then my final role at 711 was really very much a lot of all these things. So speaking with that example so that we can relate, right? So what we were focused on, obviously is machine learning at scale. 711 also had good scale, 50 million plus customers. We were a few of the things that we really operationalized on the machine learning and data science side of Things were obviously personalization programs. We created our own internal ensemble tools to really create bake offs and mixed modeling coming from various sources, vendor driven solutions and internal solutions. We also did a lot in the generally forecasting and supply chain forecasting and inventory forecasting and that side of things. So obviously that was middle of COVID So we all know how amazing forecasting worked during COVID For most organizations we were getting beaten back into because people hated us. And that was fun times. But we did a lot of those things at scale, I think a lot of homegrown, I think product development. One of the things that I'm focused on will absolutely be doing that here also is not just machine learning or analytics as an output, but really the end to end value chain of data, right? Integrating data at scale, ensuring that models, if as needed, are running as real time as needed. Getting that output integrated into not just APIs or consumable, but really ensuring that an application is built to drive insights and actions, right? So whether I build those applications or not, but ensuring that not just take act, machine learning is done. There is an output intelligence out there and you stop. But really the charter is to ensure that true business value is generated through applications that solve problems, not just analytics. That's kind of probably an introduction of what my charter is, what I plan to do. Very informal. If there's a problem that the data team can solve, I'd like to solve that. Let's put it this way. Love it. Thanks a lot. Just for the introduction, I do have a couple of follow up questions, but I'll put that on the back burner before we give our introduction as well. Do you want to go ahead and introduce yourself first? Sure. So just basically my background studied from IIT Karaspur, did my electrical engineering from there, and then spent six years working with a hedge fund called World Fund, where we were using a lot of data to build trading strategies and trading models. During that time, I also spent like the later part of those six years in being a part of portfolio management team. I was managing 600 million in assets for worldwide. And we worked on a lot of things around optimization, specialty, risk modeling and so on. And during that time I was also a member of the CEO office, looking after various growth initiatives for the company. Expanded from seven to 22 countries with a team of three members. So that was again a very good learning experience. Started investing into startups, like in small amounts and then wanted to actually build something myself. So left my job in 2020. Nikunjana is Sheikh, where my friends from KGP and they were also on the same boat. So almost around the same time, we had left our jobs and we built a first start up in the talent space called Endhire, where we were helping companies hire technically with its software engineers through our platform. And in that we were also trying to use ML algorithms to match candidates to jobs. And while the building of the algorithms was one part of it, when we had to actually productionize those into real systems, we faced the challenge ourselves. We took one month or so in understanding cloud systems to sync together a number of open source and things like that to finally get a system running in a reliable manner. And we were having a discussion about the kind of system Nikon Javishek had seen at Facebook in terms of operationalization of ML. And we thought that it took like 15 minutes, 30 minutes to kind of do those things there. So can we bring a really good operationalization platform to other companies? And then we sold our first startup and then we started Profound. That's roughly my journey. That's amazing. Awesome. So I'll also briefly introduce myself. Same institute as a rock for Undergrad and then I moved to the US for my masters, so I went to UC Berkeley here, and since then I primarily stuck to the Bay Area. I worked at a startup called Reflection, which could be interesting for you, by the way, given your new role here is because Reflection actually Gap used to be one of the customers of Reflection. Have you heard of them? Yeah, they're under personalization platform for digital personalization or something, right? What is it? Yes, recommended systems, personalization algorithm for search and email marketing and stuff like that. Basically, I think Big Lots uses them. One of the places that kurvita and I work together was Big Lots. And bigots is a reflection. Customer. I didn't know that Gap is also a customer. You think Gap was a customer or is a customer? So it's been a while that I left Reflection. So I don't know what's the situation until I was there. I know we were working very closely with Gap, like the attach basically we used to work with all of these. Yeah, basically. Like there initially I started with building out all of these recommendations systems and personalization algorithms and maybe spent a couple of years doing that. And after that, the last year and a half, I spent time building out a horizontal machine learning platform because by that time Reflection had grown to a point where we had multiple teams building out machine learning models and it kind of made sense to operationalize the common. Elements across these teams. So that's a project that I took up and we of course learned a lot through the process and also made sure that our developers became decently, more productive, like roughly 40%, 50% is what we observed. Wow. With that I joined Facebook and that's where I saw a remarkable difference between a homegrown system that we had at Reflection versus what Facebook had built out. As you would imagine, I literally saw tools built out and speed of development that we didn't even imagine. We didn't think that it was possible. While we were at Reflection. So that was a very stark learning experience for me. Again at Facebook, I did not actually work on building out the platform, but. More as a user of the platform. Because I was building out machine learning models there and post that once I quit Facebook. The journey was similar to a rock where we built out our first startup and then got to Truefoundry. I think we just described the thing. Awesome. That is amazing. All right, I did have a couple. Of follow up questions. Good. Yeah, just a couple of follow up questions. So you mentioned about, like you mentioned one thing very interestingly when you were describing your role, which is how machine learning initiatives fall directly within your umbrella of whatever reporting chain. But you mentioned that your team will support the data science initiatives. So you kind of separated machine learning data science. Could you elaborate on this a little bit? It's probably more of lingo than anything else. The point is that we don't want to be in a place where the engineering team needs to own all data science, all model development, all model although obviously academically there is difference between data science and machine learning. But I didn't mean the difference from that perspective. What I meant was I do also need to run this platform where various business groups can hire data scientists and run their analytics and come up with suggestions of things that can be done. Right. Now whether some of those analysis convert into production scenarios with running AI or ML, either of those things, they kind of would fall with me to operationalize. But the idea was that when I said data science was more loosely around the business analytics and the data science related to business analytics enabling of that and then my role would be more of operational things that's kind of got it. Okay, that's very very helpful. And the second thing that I wanted to understand was, like, some of these products, like, from what I understand, Gap also internally builds out some of these recommendations, systems and search algorithms and stuff like that, right? So would these products be like these product teams would be your customers, or would it directly fall within your scope of Gap? So, again, both things, right? What I do want to encourage here culturally is kind of best off and governance, right. I think those are the things that are other than organizations, tech organizations like Facebooks and all you want to see that generally that's a challenge, right? Because there's multiple teams competing, trying to solve the same problems they are trying to bring in vendors and Gaps, like vendor crazy, right. So just in the personalization space, we have three internal teams trying to solve problems. We have seven vendors in play, right. So we have seven reflections in play here, right? I don't know if reflection is one of them. That's why I was a little bit surprised that in my fact finding, I haven't heard reflection, but I've heard seven other vendors that exist. Right. So that governance of data science, advanced analytics, whatever it is, so that we can build an experimentation platform, a best of scenario on some link, whatever it is. Right. So, again, that's long answer, but I think they could be my customers, internal customers, theme teams, building those, or I could be building those two who have built veterans. Got it? Understood. All right, this is very helpful. And just one small tidbit like that might be helpful is Reflection is actually now acquired by a company called Sitecore. So that could be another reason why you don't see that. I don't know if you're working with Sitecore. Yeah, I think we are. Yeah. Okay, sounds good. Cool. Let me give you a brief introduction about True Foundry, where we are and what's the problem that we are trying to solve. Just one other thing that I forgot to ask you. In terms of cloud, assuming Gap is not working with AWS. Azure is the primary cloud. There's a little bit of Gap here and there. GCP is also an option, but Azure is the primary cloud. Okay, understood. All right, so basically, like Ojas, Ojas Gap, Truefoundry think Anrad described some of the motivation why we started True Foundry, right? We're trying to build out our models. We realized that operationalization was hard, and we were just coming out of Facebook where we saw the state of the art system, right? So that was primarily the trigger for us to start building Ojas Gap, Truefoundry. Now, the way we think of ourselves, ojas is an ally to the platform team within large companies. Okay, so typically when you think about the role of a platform team, and just like you describe your own role, right? Like you are basically serving the data governance aspects, you're serving the machine learning developers, you'll be catering to the data security aspects of it. Like they add dev sekops angle if you think about it, right? And then there's like business impact that you want to deliver analytics team that you want to deal with, right? So there's a lot of stakeholders typically that our platform team ends up dealing with and the requirements of these stakeholders and the maturity, technical maturity of these stakeholders are also very different frequently, right? A data scientist, like call it a citizen data scientist, if I may use that term, will want things to be built in a very specific way that they can play around with the Jupiter notebook and deliver some results on an analytics tool. Whereas a sophisticated machine learning engineer who is building real time recommender system will probably want things in a very different way and then a business final business decision maker will want things in a very different way, right? It turns out that a platform team ends up serving a lot of different stakeholders. Now, building out a platform generic enough that can serve all these stakeholders from scratch is a very large ordeal, right? You are basically building out something extremely dumbed down version of your platform and a very sophisticated version of your platform. So what we realized is we can basically do a lot of under the hood plumbing kind of things basically as a platform. The truefoundry is building on top of the internal platform teams within the companies can build layers that interfaces with their own developers, that interfaces with their own stakeholders, basically, so that you have the maximum context on what's happening inside, but you really don't need to have all the context that's happening outside of the company. Like by todd the new version or todd serve becoming more efficient than Tfserv or whatever. Those are the things that we potentially handle essentially. So that's practically the problem that we are trying to solve, building a platform on top of which other platform teams can build. Now that said, I will narrow it down a little bit further, Ojis, because as a startup you can't be solving all the problems that a platform team is solving. So if you think about the entire data chain, from building out your data pipelines data transformations, to getting into analytics systems, building out feature engineering layers, et cetera, and then getting machine learning aspects of it, right? Model building, model training, deployments, et cetera, we come at the model level so we don't actually deal with a lot of data pipeline feature engineering analysis side of it. We come at the model level, we help people in the training deployment and the monitoring stages of the model. Okay, so imagine basically a place where a data scientist can come run like data scientists or an ML developer can come run really quick experiments on which model is actually working better, once they have realized that here's the model that works better then we help them deploy the model. And here we actually pay very special attention towards different types of deployment. Like, if you're building a recommended system, it's time sensitive, 60 millisecond response time, we can do that. If you are building something which can be dealt with more offline batch inference kind of things, we can do that. So we actually cover a wide range in terms of the deployment here, and then closing the loop with monitoring. Because especially in ecommerce, data drift happens frequently, trends change frequently. Your different festivals and events are coming which will change the shopping patterns, et cetera. So thinking about all of those and closing the loop so that when your model is still, you know it ahead of time. If your model starts underperforming, you know it very quickly. So that's the closing the loop part is something that we handle. I'll take a pause here to see if you have any questions on the platform or the, like, scope that we cover. No, I think I think, again, things around the ML Ops, that's kind of what you're playing with, right? So now the question is really what makes you different than existing players there, right? Because what you explain is, sure, there are multiple players, some of them specialize in some past, data Robot does something else. H Two is bringing something else to the table. What differentiates you? Sure, yeah. Great question. So there are two things that I'm going to answer when I try to describe what differentiates us, right. In general, when you think about all these platforms that are described by the Data robot, you could be talking about Data IQ. You could also mention Azure ML, given Azure is your cloud of choice, right. Each of these players, the platforms are designed such that maybe like, barring Azure ML a little bit, but definitely Data Robot and Data IQ type of platforms that you use it as we deliver our platform. Basically, if you think about how Data IQ or Data Robot are positioned, here's a platform. We do end to end things. You get what you see, but you deal within the scope that we have defined for you, right. It seldom happens within a company that you get a clean slate to work with. Like, now that you have joined as a VP of Data, it's very unlikely that you'll be like, okay, go build all the systems from scratch. No, you are actually going to replace the engine on a moving train, right? So you need to work with your existing systems, which does not work very well with these, like, you know, take it or leave it kind of platforms, basically. So one core differentiator that we have in terms of compared to other platforms is we are designed to work with existing systems. Okay, describe that more in detail about what I mean by designed to work with existing systems. So, for example, you may tell me that, hey, I already have this feature store like Tekton or Feast that I'm working with. Can you work with them or? I already have my entire secret management layer that comes along with Azure and my authentication layer that comes with Azure. Now your platform needs to work with those auth and secret management layers. You could also tell me that, hey, I'm using this model registry that's built by data bricks like ML Flow or whatever, and like everything else, I can use yours, but I want to continue using my model registry. So if you think about all these different bits and pieces of the components that you might already be using, we actually fit in very well with those components and only solve the parts of the problem that you care about the most as an incremental shift on your platform. Basically. Does that make sense to begin with? It does. I'm just asking the questions again. Right? My point is a challenge. The thing is, I love working with startups more than anybody else. I know we're going to run out of time anytime, but the fact is you will bring flexibility that a larger player does, and I do understand that. Is that going to be worth it? Is that going to be solving a massive problem for us? Here some of the things that I've inherited right now, they're going with the Databricks. So we're a big databrick shop, as most Azure cloud shops are, because Azure own ML of offering sucked all these years. And so if you're on Azure, you're by default on database. But anyway, so the point is databricks has their feature factory or something that they are kind of pushing hard at us. That's being considered. Data robot is something that they piloted POC. So there are things that I've inherited that kind of sit here. But what I would think is because we don't want to go deep down right now, but what I would think is give me a few months, give me some time, let me try to set up an organization, clean up a few things and set directions going forward and then we should keep talking. Let me bring a few technology people in. I haven't done the hiring, I just kicked off the hiring. I want to hire some people that I know that would be my people. So once we get going on this, I would love to continue conversations and see if there's an opportunity. Because again, right now trying to as I said, some of the problems are being solved. Some tools exist in there. To bring you in for something that's already been solved by somebody else would be a little bit of a friction thing. So give me some time and we should keep talking. I think we'll just cut to the chairs and I'll say I'm absolutely interested. I do want to bring in some people in before we go any further. Absolutely, we can totally do that. There are two things I would like to add here in the interest of time. Number one, which is like data breaks. You mentioned about database, right? Actually, as True Foundry we work with again, in line of what we are trying to break, database focuses more on the data pipeline. I was thinking if it's my collection. No, I think it's nicknames'okay. This is better. Yeah, let's try now. I think we can hear you. Maybe after the video. Go ahead. Okay. Yeah, sorry. I think just two points that I wanted to highlight. Number one, which is we work very well with databricks because databricks focuses on the offline and batch inferencing side of things, whereas Truefoundry score strength is on the real time inferencing side of things, which is again very interesting in the context of e commerce because we have a lot of such use cases. So that's one thing. We already worked with three enterprises that are already using data bricks, by the way. Okay. So generally the two don't go very well together. The second thing is I'll take just 1 minute and show you a little bit of the platform so you have at least a mental model of where Truefoundry comes in. And then we can always do the rest in our follow up conversations. Is that okay? Sure. Hello? Yeah, go ahead. Connection is a bit weak. Hello? Okay, let's blame it on Google. I don't know. Google is messing up. Can you hear me? No. I think you are breaking. I think we are also running out of time. So we want to be wary of your time as well. Would you have some time, like 15 minutes where we can set up? We'd love to at least show you the platform and just get your feedback so that you also have a mental model as you kind of look at the data problems internally at Cap and try to solve this. You have a mental model of also what we kind of thinking and at the right time, when you want to kind of loop in other folks, we can do that. So maybe sometime next week, if you can allocate like 20 odd minutes or so, that will be great. We are not able to hear you somehow. Okay, not next week. That's fine. You want to suggest any time or maybe a week after or something like that? MIDF. Okay, perfect. So MIDF. Maybe something in the let me see. Should I chat with Robbie and try to get a time for midfab with you? Yes. Okay, I'll chat with Robbie. I'll try to get a time and then we'll just take that to kind of show you what we have been building as well. Take your feedback and then also give you a picture of where we are. And that way we can we can take care of help in the journey. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Somehow we are not able to hear you but it seems you are so thanks again for taking out the time deli appreciate. Bye.
