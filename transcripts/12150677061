Good. You are traveling to work now. Yeah. Got it. Okay. Just give me 1 second. Okay? Yeah. So, all right, I think a couple of at least one or two folks from our sales team and all would also join in today because how we are doing the outreach and stuff like that. The agenda was to discuss that. But I think while folks are wrapping up their last meeting and joining in, maybe I can start giving you some just give me 1 second, okay? Yeah. 1 second. So basically I can start giving you some background about the area that we are currently focusing on how we are trying to do this entire reach out and would love to, first of all, seek your feedback on how we're dealing with things. Sure. Yeah. But I guess before I go into the details of that, let me just make sure that you're clear with the target persona the exact type of product that you. Agree. First of all, just as a quick reminder, we are building out a platform for the engineering teams, the data and the engineering teams to help them build and deploy their machine learning models faster. Right. So by design of that, typically the user of our platform are data scientists, ML developers internally within the company who are building out these models right now, turns out that in most large companies, these ML developers themselves don't make the decision of how to deploy the models. Okay. There is usually an infra team or some companies also call it a platform team, some companies call it Data Engineering team. The point is, think of it as an engineering counterpart of machine learning, basically. Okay? Okay. That's the team that typically makes a decision of how the models are deployed and maintained within the companies. Okay? Okay. Now the entire reporting of this organization, the data organization in some companies happened to the CDO, in some other companies happened to the CTO. That's the overall setup that we have seen from an orchestra perspective. The most important decision maker, at least so far, that we think is head of this platform team or head of the data engineering team, basically. Right. Who is the engineering counterpart of the model deployment and all. So that's the persona that we are typically looking to connect with. But usually we also end up using Data Scientists, head of Data Science as an influencer or as an evangelizer to make a case within the company that hey, you make our lives easier and blah, blah, blah, basically. Okay. Okay. Is that part here? Yeah. Okay. Now, the goal for us is model deployments. So it means that we are dealing with your model training, model deployment and stuff. So typically companies would deploy the True Foundry platform within their own cloud because they are not usually not comfortable sending their data outside to an outside vendor. They also end up doing things, deploying things within their own cloud. So they end up having to involve their DevOps team, typically, right. That they are. Amit truefoundry. Is getting installed in their platform. So everything is like and data is secure and stuff, basically. Hannah so these are a couple of stakeholders that generally get involved. Okay. Got you any questions so far? No. All right. By the way, before I continue, my co founder, Anragh has joined as well. Anrag, as I mentioned to you earlier, that Anrag also is from Karappur. I'm at a traffic signal. Good to meet you. Yeah. Hi, Amit. Great to meet you. Thanks for taking me for the call. And basically the sales outreach effort within the company. So it was important for him to join and learn from your experience. ANRA, as I told you offline that Ahmed is currently part of the executive team at Digital, leading a lot of initiatives, and he has also worked at Capillary and all, where he led a lot of customer outreach efforts as well. Right. So Amit mentioned to me in my last call that he's generally very interested in this entire area of how to reach out to customers and how to expand the customers, basically. And he's willing to lend us some of his time and help us in setting up this process, basically. So the idea was that in this call, we basically first bring a myth up to speed about what we are doing today so that he can basically give feedback. On top of that, according to him, what is the right strategy, what would work, what would not work, if he has any suggestions, et cetera. So the call today is primarily intended to bring Amit up to speed about where we are. I was just explaining him the persona that we are reaching out to. Like, the entire ML platform persona, who is the decision maker typically rolling up to the CTO or the Cto.org, depending on the type of the company. We have still not gotten to the different types of companies that we have explored. That's number one, that I think it would be good to catch him up with. And it would also be nice if you can explain him, like, different approaches that we are taking to reach out to these companies, what's working, according to us, what's not working, and then also getting his feedback from them. Yeah, okay, sure. Hi, Amit. Great to meet. I can walk you through a few of this. So I'll start first from the current focus area in terms of which type of companies we are reaching out to. So give me 1 second. Do you have visibility to see the screen? I'm guessing you're driving right now. Not for the next. So, in terms of basically the ICP, we are trying for two different segments currently. One is basically the ideal customer profile in terms of companies that we believe could potentially benefit from this. We are trying to different segments. Both these segments generally tend to be at least $100 million plus revenues companies. The reason for choosing that was what we realized is only after a certain scale, companies do have bandwidth to spend in ML because ML is still not core for a lot of companies. So we wanted to kind of be in the upper market segment. Now within that you can further classify it into two parts. One is say probably the upper mid market which will generally be say 100 million to 1 billion in revenues. And then the second is the proper enterprise segment, 1 billion plus in revenues in that like for the upper midmarket segment, like the major reason we believe they can benefit is because a lot of these are companies that are challenging the incumbents in the space and they are generally wanting to be ahead. So they are investing in ML and they have seen some benefit of ML already and potentially they would want to expand ML and they would not want to invest their time in building that effort out. So there is a value for an external player or an external platform being used instead of them building it out. Okay, this would be companies like upwork just give me 1 second, I'm trying to upwork instacart. You are aware of these companies from the companies like that, from Indian market. If you have to look at it like this, charge B, charge B kind of companies would potentially fall in into this. Even Capillary would potentially fall into this ripling another one that kind of emerged from the Indian market. So this will fall into this segment and then the second segment of enterprises there. The primary reason is all of these enterprises are now making a move towards trying to use ML. Like many have tried it, but still a lot of them have not realized value in the enterprises. We are not targeting the tech heavy ones like the Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Words of the World. It's more like less tech heavy companies like look at the healthcare sector or the pharma sector or the retail sector where there's still not full penetration of ML initiative, even the publishing sector and things like that. So those kind of spaces where there is less PO tech that has been used and people are trying to make a move is the segment we are targeting. One of the things in that segment that we are trying to validate is whether it makes sense for these organizations to build their ML on top of multicloud as well. So that is one of the things we are validating. So these are the two primary segments. Prior to this we are ditching out to a lot of startup series companies but at least we didn't see a lot of good traction there for two reasons. One is none of them were willing to pay for POC's and they wanted a benefit out of it. And we were also not sure if they will convert into paying customers. And second is, for a lot of them, like they worry about simple ML, things like, okay, taking a model and deploying them to Prod and that's it. But they don't necessarily care about the entire liability aspect or the stability aspect. And then a platform like ours becomes less important to them and they can get that done with open source or simple tools that are existent in the market. Okay. In terms of the channel for each out, the primary channel that we have used across the board has been LinkedIn. So we use generally LinkedIn of the founders to reach out to folks in order to kind of at least get them on a call to understand what page their ML is in. Before we get into the details of how we are reaching out, maybe Amit, if you have any follow up questions on this part, right? What type of customer, what type of product, et cetera, et cetera, let's make sure that we are on the same page there. So if you have any questions, maybe we can answer that. So I don't have questions. I have a couple of thoughts that were coming to my mind as Anurag was PK, right? Yes. Anurag, if I were you, right, I would look at the zero to one sales approach that were followed by the following companies. And I'm sure you would have been studying all of these already, potentially and maybe more. But the top few that come to mind are Cubo DRUMO, Neo, four J data bricks. Some of these guys, right, are essentially targeting a very similar persona, right? I mean, at Capillary I was and we were selling to marketing CMO, right? Yes. Have you guys spoken to these four or five or similar companies in terms of what their zero to one sales wins were? At capillary, what we followed was we had a set of industry advisors or industry consultants who are also early ages, and they would sort of make these warm connects to marketing teams of retailers. 1011 when Capillary started 1112 India, but essentially to traditional retailers, we got these industry experts who had their skin in the game by way of India investing. So that's what worked when the target persona was the CMO. But these four, five companies that I mentioned, these are the ones selling to the personas that you mentioned and the kind of products that you mentioned. So have you guys studied these companies? Yes. Not in detail. Amit not in detail? Not in detail? No, not in detail. Not in detail. Okay. We have seen some of the other companies, not exactly this, but for example, App Dynamics is one example that we have studied because there is a case study published by an user on that and similarly a few other companies, but the exact companies like Data Breaks, Cue Ball, et cetera that you mentioned about. We are trying to do that, reach out. Currently where we are through your Sequoia. Whatever network in an absolute hustle mode without wasting time. Get access to the founders or the early pre CDC teams of those companies because they have done exactly this and that's what you need to do. I mean, anything else that I tell you on how Capillary has done will not be useful at this stage. It will be useful at one to ten stage where you're talking about scaling the sales model, bringing processes on inside sales, demand and demand and automation, all of that right? Beyond one it starts to get a little more standard in terms of how you leverage content, how you reach out to enterprises, what you do, et cetera, et cetera. But I think the zero to one story is highly space dependent. So the faster you get a sense of how these guys are similar I don't mean just these four, but how these similar. So for example, our conversion ratio for those guys, right? Like for example, Buzziradvisors was a company, Herbinder was an investor, early angel in Capillary, right. The depth of our connection in terms of understanding that problem statement doing these pilots PCs was much higher because there was a warm connect. Right now, I don't know for Cubo and new four J and Drmeotype data bricks companies in Clear what worked in their first one year and that's what we need to figure out and see if that has a higher chance of working than any other approach that I might tell you from my experience. It's a limited point that I was making. Okay, got it. One thing we were thinking of amit is reaching out to say folks like folks of data bricks and all, but getting access to the free series motion like time teams of this company is a good idea. We can try and see if there's a way to access that. Yeah, it could be X employees, just do a LinkedIn on X employees, et cetera, et cetera, and just tell them that look, you have deep expertise in the exact area that might be very relevant and just want to pick your brains, right? Ideally, if it's like someone at Sequoia or any of your early investors oranges making that connect, great. In fact, Krishna will be able to give you a lot of this, both these maybe inputs and potentially since he's now in a core engineering role at Meta as well. If he knows people in some of those because his previous role before Meta is also in a company that would target very similar audiences for getting the name sorry, who? Krishna Mera connect will not be useful, but his previous role was in the virtualization before my time for getting the name of the company. It's normally a big company, they also sell to CTOs, but not ML or Data organization. But he will basically be able to tell you about early evangelization phases of tech focused sales process. Yeah. Guys. I'm just entering a parking lot, so in about two to three minutes I'll be up at my desk. Five minutes. Sure. Member of CEO Officer and Tata in the market expansion role like China integration of these guys with China basically reaching out to customers, expanding customers is very interesting to me. So I'm also willing to help you guys in this journey at no Advice for no Advice. He shares just because I like doing this. So I'm willing to help you guys. Basically where we are just doing an intro. Like just giving him background, moving forward. If he thinks he can help, if we think we can leverage some of his help, we can do that. Otherwise, just establish a connect and keep him around because anyway, starter register. Maybe it will be helpful for us to seek his help. I'll make an intro once he gets to his desk. Like, I think Anrag was in the middle of the conversation, so I did not interrupt the conversation when he joined. But I'll make an intro with that most likely happen there's no business. They typically outsource most of the development, even engineering later on, machine learning. Just to kind of almost think of this as managers on top of all these outsourced developers and that's it. As a CTO, that's his strategy as well. I don't want to build everything. I just want to get things built. I don't think there's any business immediately right here, but I want to dive a little bit into the details. How are you able to pull this opportunity? Take care. Okay. By the way, I spoke to someone decent profile, spent some time at Amazon Bricks. Said that she'll do some advisory, but charge $400 an hour. Of course we can negotiate and figure it out. I've just put her profile. X data Bricks. How many sites. Enterprise Account Executive but I understand what is the process workflow it's okay. Ultimately these are the guys were doing the work. Although this is pretty early on. This is not very late, but still late will be one more useful. Understand. Who are they targeting? What is their workflow like? I was looking at some of the JD's as well, just to get a sense. Do we have a set of questions that we are asking this for? Yeah, I can share that as well. Broadly speaking, I'll send this to people. I don't know if my useful, but I just feel that given his profile and it's worth connecting. Prompts. In general a profile as well. He says he's an investor. I wonder how would we invested in data bricks early on? Was it an angel? Because anderson. Hi. Hello. Hi. By the way, we also have Akshaya on the call. Akshay is a member of founder's office. Driving a lot of sales initiatives as well, currently. Sorry, are you guys all PGP? No, me and Nikkins are from KGP 2013 batch. Which wall were you guys at? Rka. I spent most of my time at KGP at RK only because KK and Anish were at RK. You know them from before. School. Interesting. I used to play the drums so wildfire. Every year I used to go to KGP. I was at B-I-T messer up for my engineering. Yeah, I saw that. And I'm at your base in Bombay, which is the one in Fort. Yeah, I was in Bombay house for the first one year. Now we are in the Tatadigital house in a separate building now. But first one year I was at the TADA Group headquarters. Okay, and where's the Tatadigital office right now? It's in Fort only fourth house. Okay. Yeah, that's a good idea. We can try and reach out to basically the pre CDC teams of these companies to see how they were doing things and how they were targeting the same person, et cetera they were targeting. One of the challenges with this bigger company is the organizational structures are very different and it's very hard to understand who would be the right person to target in that organization. For example, there will be an organization where the CDO is a decision maker and then the head of ML will report to the CDO and the head of ML will be interacting with different business units, each with their own ML units. And then. I haven't seen that happen normally. So no matter how large the company and your target is fairly large now in terms of volume of data, scale, business, everything, right? We are pretty much trying to your competition to Amazon Flipkart in India. So the scale is really large, right? Even at our scale, it makes absolutely no business sense to have a separate ML team by business unit. Okay? The only scale at which it makes sense is if your Amazon Flip cut and at that scale you would rather I mean, I don't know the details, but for any technology decision, right. It would probably be more feasible to just unless it's a consumer facing one or even for consumer facing ones, it might be more feasible to just build some of this as part of your own stack rather than buy or rent outside. Right. So I don't think, other than if you're selling to Amazon Flipkart scale, anyone else will not have a separate ML unit by business function. Very unlikely is my view. Even if they have a separate ML or Data Sciences team which is matrixed with the CDO and the business head, something like DevOps or ML Ops will make zero sense to have it they want to centrally over. So actually we are right now trying to reach out to a lot of these companies which are bigger scale, as you said. For example, if you look at just to give you an example, like Noah Test is an example when we go to that scale and we are trying to approach a lot of this fortune. 500 companies then it is by market, not business units. There will be more geographies Europe, Kyle and US which is fine, which I agree with. Yeah, sure. I think there'll be a lot of maybe safe harbor data laws et cetera, et cetera that might come in or no, because you don't take any PA data. We don't take any PA data because we install our system on their infrastructure. So that way it basically let me talk a little bit about the channels that we are using maybe. And then I'll talk about some of the major problems and some of the major questions that we have around that as well. So one is primarily we are using LinkedIn as a channel now there are other supporting channels around it like outbound messaging, referrals and so on. So LinkedIn. We generally use homeless profile. We basically try to make a list of companies wherein we find the ML team beyond a certain size, say at least beyond ten members ML team which is like data scientists plus ML people. And in that like we try to remove industries like say cloud security or autonomous vehicles and so on. And then we try and reach out to this company segment wise with different themes. So for example, I'll talk about some of the things. The one thing that we are recently doing is multi cloud ML because we are seeing that a lot of these companies tend to be multi cloud. So maybe an infrastructure, if you are able to build on top of multicloud that might be interesting to them. So that is one theme that we have used. The second theme is in sector specifically we are now trying to do like case studies, like for healthcare companies. We have two or two companies that we have worked with. So we have created small one page studies and we are reaching out to them with that theme. Then prior to this, we were trying to reach out to them with the theme of around platform themes like basically head of ML or the head of Data science. And we were trying to reach out to them that okay. Even if you have an ML, we will kind of integrate with that and we will provide a faster way to get you started on ML initiative. So these are some of the things we have been reaching out. Another thing we are trying now is in terms of the gender strategy, like cheaper, better, well as strategy against the competitors. So we're trying to look at the competitors customers and then trying to reach out to them with that strategy. And then this LinkedIn is then supported through outbound emailing campaign which we join in sequence generally of four to five emails, six emails, 80 males depending on which it is via another channel. And sometimes we'll also use like phone calls, I think. Two thoughts, right? Two thoughts. One is at this stage the productivity of a warm intro will be multiple times. When I say productivity, I mean conversion, right? I mean Roy, only the time for sales outreach will be multiple times that of a cold connect. Yes. So over index as far as possible also on warm connects for things that you've identified. Okay, not to say that the sales team shouldn't hustle and all of that, of course they should. But there should be an equally focused parallel effort, almost like another channel which you are measuring. Right. As co founders on how many leads did I get from this other warm channel? And you will see that over six months, one year, the sales velocity of the first channel will far outpace the sales velocity of the second channel in the first one year. Okay, first piece. One of the mistakes that I feel not mistaken is a learning curve at Capillary was even throughout our series A and maybe post series B and C, we started getting focused on markets as well as having enough bandwidth to be able to cater to multiple markets, right? Yes. But if you are seeing early wins at a segment of your customer base and a geography, then you should as a team decide if you want to double down on that because you will never be able to cater to enterprise as well as series A startups and you'll be able to cater to India and us. Okay. Because problems will be different. I don't know. Stack will be something will be different, at least. Again, I'm talking about Capillary seven years back. Yeah, I think it's these two things that are coming to mind. So that focus. But right now it's only focused on the, as I said, the upper segment. It's like the smaller segment we have completely let go. We are not getting to that. We are not even doing the chat, et cetera to that in terms of getting through warm connects. Right. Obviously we have tried amid some of the warm connect channels, for example, asking angels for intros and then using our own connects to us for intros. We also tried like, okay, something like a referral thing wherein if you are able to refer and someone converts, then we'll also kind of give you corresponding evangelist sales. But to be honest, the amount of referrals we get tend to be comparatively low. And a lot of time in referrals, what we see is people refer us, then people will talk, but ideally there is no need. Are there other channels that we are missing out in referrals? Like apart from the ones that I. Said, yeah, I'm not sure you're already doing that. But you need to attend events, right? And at a certain scale, once you're slightly larger and you have some money on marketing, probably even host events. In fact, one of the guys anurag that I can connect you with is a very close sort of former colleague at Capillary. His name is nick Kunj, incidentally. And he used to be at Capillary to support me on my China growth. And then post that, he joined Cubol for some time. Then he joined I think now he's with either Drama or Neo for J. I think Neo four J, right. On the sales side. Right. So he had obviously joined at a much later post Series A and all of that. He joined those companies post series A. Series B. But I've seen him do a lot of these events where he gets him a lot of his companies do these events where they get data scientists and all of that together in a room and they discuss topics of relevance. And then through that, obviously, they establish their credentials in the subject. I don't know if right now you guys will have the appetite for that, but definitely he's a good guy to speak to. He'll be a lot more specific in terms of insights for your target personas. Right? So, to be honest, I have very limited expertise in your space or selling to the CTO CDO organizations used to only sell to marketing or digital ads, right? So my knowledge that way is very limited. So at this point, I feel that's what you guys should do, right? Nick coach and unnatural, I think where I will be able to add value also is at stages where your initial product market fit has been achieved. You have, let's say, 1520 paying customers. And now you need to replicate, build on sales efficiency, hire your sales team, how to enter a market, how to figure out, et cetera. Those are things that I have done more deeply. I'm not a founder, right? And hence and I am not from that space that you guys are selling to. So as we are speaking, I'm beginning to come to this conclusion. I mean, I don't know conclusion or at least get this insight that my value add right now seems to be very limited. Your time is better usage post that. I'm very happy to help with what I know in terms of scaling a series engine, understanding what hiring mistakes we made, firing mistakes we made, everything, right. Makes sense. I completely appreciate that. Yeah. If you guys have anything more, I'm happy to hear. I have two questions that I want to understand. If you have context in terms of the organizational structure, when you would get into the salesforce, is there a particular way you do the previous search to kind of get to that? So that the sales the reason why I'm asking this is sometimes we speak to head of AI initiatives at the company, and when we go into the call, we realize that that person does not care about the real implementation and he only cares he or she only cares about the strategic goals. And they have very little visibility into what tools are being used, what is not used, and then even discovering the. Right. Person who has visibility there is becoming hard, to be honest. I think the way to think about this is for which segment within the industry segments that you mentioned. Right. For which segment is the efficiency of ML Ops a real problem? Right? For sure. It is not series A. Yeah. Because Kalini yutnaki efficiency of ML ops is a problem. ML is itself not a problem. Right. I think you're right. In terms of defining your target segment. Nikkon, when we were last weekend Target Digital, I told you that Data Sciences would be the right organization, right. To reach out to yes. More than you are speaking, it's not. Data organization is data engineering, which is a separate function, which I think as Anurag was rightly saying, you were saying in some cases reports to CDO, in some cases, CTO. At our setup, it reports to CDO. Okay, understood. Makes sense. Right. The other interplay, at least for large enterprises, is that the relationship between a CDO and a CTO, it's very lovely, typically, right? Yes. What you will need to figure out is whether the CDO has a tools budget, which is part of the CDO's PNL, or for tools, all tools and enablement is he going to rely on the CTO. Right. So both reporting of the data engineering head and the budget owner needs to be established before getting into that meeting. Right. What I would do is these are not questions you can ask ahead of AI or Data Sciences on a call. Right. For large enterprises and because in any market in your large enterprise type space, there'll be like ten companies. Right. I mean, unless it's us or China. Right. India may be thus pundit based company. Right. In the filters that you mentioned. Right. Slightly more junior folks today who are not heads. Right. Talk to them and try to understand both of these pieces. Who does Data Engineering report to and where do you think the budget comes from? Okay. Or you can ask your investors to talk to CXOs and try to get that input and then play along. That right. Because if you start selling to the CTO and the CTO becomes your Evangelizer inside the company, but the budget is owned by CTO and the CTO has different that is a dead end. Yeah, exactly. It's kind of organizational thing only is becoming the hardest because as we are speaking, as you said, it's very important to speak to both. Right. Like, we cannot just stick to one persona and be okay. Clearly understand basic data. Who is your primary budget owner? Is it CD or budget owner? The budget owner has to be the most important thing. Right. Like when we are talking here yes. It is not the team that is running it. It is actually the team that owns the budget. Yes. Okay. In addition to fact that they will sign your checks, they will also have the incentive to reduce cost. One other question around this and there's one actual situation that would be helpful to get your insight into. We are working with a big company where we were kind of trying to work with the platform team and we went through the POC, talking to the head of the platform or the person who manages this thing. We hadn't spoken to the budget owner and what happened is we went through the POC and then the POC is complete. And now ideally the time is where they would want to take a decision of whether they want to go ahead with us or not. So from a technical perspective they decided that okay, they want to go ahead. But then they asked us the commercials and we mentioned the commercials to them. But after that the responses from them have been very bleak. And that person is also not the budget owner. That person seeks budget from another team in that organization. And I'm afraid that because the responses have been generally a red signal there. So what kind of thing can we do here to ensure that at least this organization we are not losing? Because we also installed our software in their interpreters. They have gone through a testing from a technical point. We prepared like a roadmap of what we will work on. But the budget owner was never in the picture. We never had a direct connect with the budget owner and creating some issues. If the functional load of your initiative is not able to make the case and put through the budget, right through the budget owner, then it's basically a very difficult problem to solve. Then the only other way is who's the budget owner, which is the team? I mean, you mentioned this team, but who is the budget owner, which team is the budget owner? So basically there's two things here. Number one, which is this person's boss himself. So there are two parts of the budget here. So this director of platform that we are speaking with, his boss, which is a VP, is basically going to sign the platform budget. Okay? But then he's getting another component of the budget through the end consumer of the platform. So let's say a business unit which is going to use their platform will sponsor some part of the budget. So these are the two places where he's seeking the budget from. And he is very open with you and saying that I'm not getting budget from the second business owner of a piece. No, he's not saying that way currently. He's basically just like saying that I am basically making this case with these guys, evangelizing the platform, getting the budget here and all of that. I think he sounded very confident until two weeks ago that everything is sorted. And I think for the last two weeks he has been a little bit slow. And yesterday in a call with me, he told me that we just went through layoffs. And this guy is the VP or the director of the data platform. He needs group director, basically. So this guy is the group director of the data platform and he reports to the VP, basically. Okay. The company is more than $20 million. Plus company in India or US? The US. And the VP is from the tech organization or data organization? From the tech organization. From the tech organization. Okay. I think very specific don't have a specific input that is coming in at this point because someone is saying, you will lay off. See? I mean, finally on sale. Right. The way to do this would be like with the people that I have sold to, right. Uncle, he'll tell you my style of doing that is doing any sales. And I'm sure you have sales guys doing it also is to establish a very deep relationship with the customers. If you have that level of connect and that level of confidence that he's telling you the right thing, then it's a dead end. Okay? It can't move, basically. But if you don't have that level of connect, then whatever he's telling you might be bullshit. Exactly. Those are the things that obviously, I don't know, you guys will know better. Right? But always, whoever is fronting the customer should be extremely close. Extremely close. Like, you should be able to tell the guy, if you're free on Thursday, should we catch up for dinner? Yeah. And if that is a relationship that your Spock has with that VP right. Or whoever that your Spock is who is telling you, then it is a dead end. Right. And if you don't have that connect, then you either establish that level of relationship I don't know how, but you establish that level of relationship to get the actual picture of what is happening. So that he makes you an ally in this sale process. He considers you as a partner rather than a number on efficiency that he needs to reduce for which he needs your company's help. Yeah. Like all successful sales in large enterprises right. Are done. They're the head of the sales team. On the SaaS side is a trusted partner whose only intent is to make the CXO or VP successful. Right? That's all. Nothing else matters. Again, I'm selling to Nickoons, and Nickoons is the VP, Nikon. I am as close to Nikkun as any of his direct reports in the company. And that's how enterprise deals get done. It doesn't get done otherwise. I've seen it at Capillary when we scaled four Series C. I am seeing it here at Tara Digital. That is how it works. I'm giving away india china APAC Context I have sold in the US, but not enough. But I think that's how it works. There also large enterprise, not mid sized large enterprise, 20 billion plus has to work that way. If you don't have that, it's okay. It's a maturity curve. But the goal should be like that. The front end guy should be in bed with the VP or CXO. Only then it will work. Yeah. Just one question. In this kind of setup wherein everything is pretty much remote and I know things have transitioned back in the day, how often would you meet these folks? Is it comfortable, is it easy to establish this connect remotely or CXOs of the cognizant and all they're doing is just winding and dining these people? I just want to know how was your experience of Capillary? I have very limited knowledge of large It services implementations. But it might make sense for you because they are also sometimes selling to CIOs, CDOs sorry, CTOs. CTOs and CDOs as well. Right. I was selling more to CMOS. Right. But I think regardless of what you're selling, there are like some cultural and I have only sold in outside India. Have not sold in India. Right. I think your sales guy needs to understand the pulse of what is required to establish a connect that is more important than the frequency of connect. Right. Like, if I am selling to someone in New York, I will talk about the subway. If I am selling to someone or actually outside country, anywhere else, I will probably, depending on the state, I will probably talk about football. And I actually studied NFL anyway. I mean, people like Peyton Manning and all of that. And I was a cricket fan for the two years that I was in the US. I tried to become an NFL fan, not a fan, but at least to be able to have a conversation about Peyton Manning with a guy that I would say, well, that's how conversation will start, right? When you're on a call waiting for 300 people to join with a white American guy from Louisiana, you will talk to him about Peyton Manning and Brad, whatever. Right. You will not talk to him about. So for me, it was music. Right. So I'm just giving you an example. When I was in China, I could speak Chinese and I was very passionate about China as a culture. So anyways, I think those are very relationship oriented that anyone fronting your relationship has to consciously work on, almost as a KRA. Or you hire people who are native in those markets, which I know small startups initially can't do. Right. Capillary couldn't do. We have to transform ourselves to be those people. Right. I don't know if that makes sense. That might seem very high level, but that's how I've seen large enterprise leaderships work. That makes sense. Yeah. Or you have such a compelling proposition with the ROI or the cost of your innovation on product that it is a no brainer for the guy in which the relationship doesn't matter. We have to look on relationships. Right. So it depends. Okay. I think it will be great if you could connect to the person you are mentioning from new for J to get an understanding of things. Also we will let our end try to reach out to folks from the series a counterparts of these companies that we sell to enterprises. Hello. Sorry. The other question that I was going to ask him is this around? Like, how do you even discover, like, which like, for a particular X, like, say, the CTO, the CDO CIO in that organization, whether that is what do I say, balance sheet item, or whether that's, like, a second degree item, like, that they don't care about. So how do you kind of because it becomes very different. Like in some cases you will typically. Ask them questions like what is your what are your priorities for this year? Right? If you say cost optimization or innovation on DevOps or ML Ops is an objective, then there is a tier case right, where there is a need for your product. If not, then you do hard test it's a harder that's what I was. Guessing for example, the example I gave wherein we have to ask for the budget. I was wondering that why this ask for the budget is needed? Because generally these companies would be making the budget plan before the end of the year. So by October, November, the budget plan should be ready. So if someone is telling at this point that there is a need for a separate budget, I'm a little confused as to how do you navigate this situation because how often is this intermittent budget like budgeting done, all of those things like how do you kind of. There is no rule. There are no rules there. It varies a lot by company and for all you know, it might just be a reason for him to I mean, there's a reason that he's giving you to be able to not be able to see it for internal other reasons. Right? Yeah. Maybe they're saying layoffs who act of a budget is basically they don't have costs. No, they need approvals. Yeah, understood. Yeah. I think one of the things as an argument that we'll do a couple of take up, a couple of suggestions that you just gave work with that. I will send out a separate email to you if you can make an introduction with the CDO. And I will also tailor the pitch according to the data engineering under CTO. And I'll also mention the thing that you mentioned about the Mad Street then besides Matt Street and how can we potentially add value? Just one question for you on that side. Have you seen Data Tatadigital taking an approach where all machine learning is outsourced, most machine learning outsourced to match return or there are internal teams also trying to build out some models and stuff. Basically they're the one trying to build the models. ML models are not with any of the in house teams, but with regard to how much of the ML Ops DevOps it I don't know. Really? No idea. Zero idea. I see. Okay. Will be the head of data engineering and not the data. But anyway, the main guy is the CDO, so I'll talk to him. Let me just talk to him. It's fine. Even if it's not the right time, at least talk to him. Understand what are the priorities and challenges today. And there by the way, if you have any suggestions to me, like I think you were giving some suggestions for how we reach out to these other folks and what kind of conversations to have. If you can also give any specific suggestions, talk about these things, these might be his priorities, et cetera. Sure. That guy talk to if he has time, he'll anyway speak with you if I tell him. But yeah, he's fine. If that closer to that call, if that gets set up, I can talk to you about him. He's a good friend. CEO sounds good. Nice. Yeah. See, the other last piece that I wanted to leave you guys with, I don't know if you guys are already doing it, but essentially what we used to do at Capillary was and you can't publish these online, but basically just have comparison sheets ready with your competitors or whatever alternatives they are doing right now. Your charmatch dimension, mickey, we have this tick cross or a number or how we are doing this better, et cetera, like a one page, which very clearly articulates to that guy and helps that guy sell internally and build the case for Y two. Foundry, right? To Foundry versus X versus Y, company versus do nothing. Right? Yeah. Are you doing that? I think we have done it for a couple of competitors, but I don't think we've done an extensive job at this. By the way. We have to do more extensive job. And at your stage, be also honest about it. Right. We are very early stage. We have these are things that we want to do today. We are not doing it right. So then to me, as a CDO, you're saying we will do that also. Right. Makes sense. Transparency is the most important thing that I have learned because you need that guy to also be retained. Right. The only time in life where I sold something that we had not fully built at my personal confidence, I was GM of the China market and I wasn't fully confident we'll be able to build that. I sold with 50 50 confidence that we'll be able to get this through. Okay. We were not able to get this through. That person stopped picking up my calls and terminated the contract. And that person used to be the person who I had that relationship with. And it was a lady, actually. But I could get dinner with her whenever I wanted in groups of two, three CMOS in Shanghai. And then she batted for Capillary. Right. And then I could not deliver that right. So hence the video making that comparison sheet. Also, clearly call out what gaps you are, because tomorrow you need that person more than you think is the value of this contract today, especially for large enterprise? Because the world is small with large enterprise. Right, understood. Giving you a lot of gang, which is very commonsensical. But I hope it was a good use of your time and your team. Yeah, it was. Thank you. Thank you so much, Amit, for taking out the time. I will keep you posted with the next steps, okay? Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
