Hello? Hello, Yogesh? Hello? Yeah, who is this? Hi. Yogesh. This is Niquinh. I thought it's 930 and it's my bad, man. So sorry. Should I give you a call a little bit later or something? If you can wait for just ten minutes, I'm outside within ten minutes. After ten minutes, will you join the Google call or do you want me to call you on the phone? We can do over the phone, whatever. Makes okay, take care of it. Let's join the Google call in like maybe then. Ten minutes then. Okay. Okay, bye bye. Thank you. Hello? Yugisha on mute. Can you hear me? Hi, Yogic. Yes, I can hear you. How are you doing? Doing good, man. I think two Yogesh are here, am I right? Yes. Did you join from a phone or something? Yeah, I jumped from a phone. I don't know. Should I remove the other? It's okay, ma'am. How does it make a difference? That's true, it does not. You are on the east coast, right? Yes, buddy, I'm on East Coast. Okay, nice, nice. So Yogesh, Taranti might have given you some context already, right? A little bit about what I wanted. To chat about and stuff. Yeah, he gave up context and let's talk about it, because I'll tell you, I was also talking to one more lady. I'll tell you Bindu. I don't know whether you know Bindu or not. Do you know Binu? No. Give me more context. Okay, I will tell you. Her basically. Abakers AI. Yeah, I do. Yeah. They're in same business as you, am I right? Yes, similar. I was actually in touch with them and that's how I was saying I know the company's motorcycle. What's the purpose? Is it exactly same or are you. Guys doing little differently? No, so I think it's in the same space, but I think the operation is fairly different because I think the approach to Abacus AI is more like building AI in ML ops. Right? And we are building ML ops for AI. I guess that's the main difference. Got it? Yeah. All right. So we generally believe that so far, like, ML has not reached a stage where you need to apply AI itself to the ML ops processes. But I think with most companies that fairly early in their machine learning journey still it isn't a properly solved problem. So we actually start with much more fundamentals to meet the companies where they are, I guess. Got it. So, Nikhan, I'll tell you my read. On the situation of basically how I see the corporate America world. Then let's talk about. So I see. Three different type of companies here. Okay. The companies which are really, really using ML and Way, advanced Stage, Take, Facebook, all these companies which are way ahead. Okay? Yeah. Then there are companies which are small segment companies like where TD was working. They will say reflection bloom reach. They will use the word we are using AI ML but they actually never use that. They will build a rule engine behind the scene. The reason is their business operations is like that. Because the funding comes from merchandisers. If merchandisers are paying the money, then they need the voice in the game. So they don't let any ML engine ever survive. Right. Hot packed. Okay, then third is the corporate America section which is like company like CVS. CVS is a fortune for there could. Be 1400 also where we say a lot that we are doing ML and in reality we'll not be using ML anywhere. That's a hard fact. Okay? Now the reality why we are not. Using, there could be one small percentage less than 1% which are using. And if they are using, they want to do everything themselves. But the companies like us. It'S not. That we don't want to do. There is a lot of political maneuvering you need to do to overtake something. Okay, I'll give a simple example like chatbot. That should be the simplest thing. You will say hey, what's the big deal about chat box? Use any of the dialogflow, use any so many software out there today. Go in outside and just build it. What's the big deal about it? Build the fulfillment engine, build the intent. And response, you will get it. But reality is in my own area. I've been struggling to just build a. Chat boat in last nine months. Just political. Okay? And what you are trying to solve is let's say in a company like seniors, we really start using ML. Then comes the maturity of it. That's where you are actually going into that. Okay? When you build different models, maturity, that is where you guys will come into picture to operationalize it, whether it is somebody doing the study, with what data set you did it, how did you train everything those things. If I'm not wrong, that's what you're trying to automate. Am I right in first of all a summary of what you guys are. Doing or I'm way off. You're not way off for sure. There is just one thing that I would like to add here. Yogesh. So actually a lot of what we're trying to build is call it day zero type of things also. So what I'm going to say is initially when you build your first machine learning model, you don't care about all the maturity around it, all the debugging, monitoring, logging, all those things don't matter. All you want is I want to build a model, I want to get some business value out of it. Right? That's the only thing that you really want in the beginning. So we actually start there literally somebody working like on a jupyter notebook or something can deploy some models and stuff like that. And once you start doing that over and over again, that's when you care about maturity. And hopefully at that point you don't need to go find another solution altogether. Build something roundup the platform scales with your needs. So I think that's the only caveat. But generally I think by the way. My read of the industry is very. Similar to you that machine learning is the thing that everyone talks about. No one actually uses. Most people don't use it actually. That's in my read of the situation as well. Okay, see that is what I was thinking. You must be having a customer intend you would have done your research before opening up a startup. You got to feed money, so it must be somebody got impressed. Okay, how are you thinking about your customer base? Who are you targeting? Actually, that's the question I will ask you. So generally, actually we are targeting these large companies who actually have not built a lot of machine learning expertise but practically know that either now, four years later, three years later, if they don't five years later, they don't end up using machine learning. They're at risk basically. So for example, we already started working with a company called Synopsis, which. We. Started working with Reliance. So these are like all large companies, but they're not necessarily known for their expertise in machine learning. That's the general target segment that we are going after. Got it? Absolutely. Obviously not the Googles and Facebook and Uber of the world because the value add, value ad, you can't do any. Yeah, but with these large companies, we have realized that they want to do a lot of things, but they get stuck with a lot of things and they need that kind of customizability etcetera. Which is something that the cloud providers don't end up providing. Their documentation is really bad, so they pretty much need more hand holding. And hand holding is something that as a startup they can afford, but as an AWS, they can't afford too much of that. No, I agree with you and that is where I think I got the. Context now and now I know the thing. Now you can ask me the question how can I help or not? And how I think about it. Because I tell you, from my perspective. Sitting in corporate America, nothing works like. The way you think the world works. Totally different. It's about finding out a relationship and. Saying, hey, let's spend some money. You have money, let me spend some money for you. So that's what we need to do. It's not about a real need or not a need. It can become a need when we make some business value, really business case out of it. Okay, right. That's what I was telling was talking about something I said terran one basic thing, deliver by date, which Narva is doing. We can't even predict that. Forget about anything else. We don't build delivered by date engines and we talk about all kinds of MLS. These are the hard facts. So that's what I see as south. Of America, what we need to do is more of a finding where we. Can have connects and actually see the mindset that hey, do you need help. But you need to have relationship. That's how I look at overall industry. I really really am telling you, if there is a company where there is a will to start up ML and. There is a real team, they will. Never ever go and say, hey, I want to automate something. They will not even go into that mode. They will build it. Whereas companies like CVS, they will spend. A million of dollars without even knowing why they are spending money. So target audience is your choice. I can help you reaching out to few people. I can help you in changing the view of your sales pitch. Right? Because I believe the sales pitch needs to change, right? That's a whole crux. What am I here for? Because nobody even understands or nobody needs, hey, I need some automation, or some everybody is like so much, hey, I'm getting a salary. I just care that this is a use case for this year. If this gets the ROI, either I will leave this company or I will get big bonus. I'm out of this area. I don't care about what happens after four years. So how many people are there, that's. Kind of a thing. So you tell me now. Again, this is my version of what. I think about this area and what I know about this area, right? So actually, Yogesh, before I get started with basically this kind of engagement in terms of customer intros, interactions, et cetera, actually I wanted to check a long time ago, I know that you had mentioned about engaging with startups in different capacities, like angels and stuff like that, right? Just like Garandee is engaging with us at this point. I wanted to first of all check like have you already done some of that since the last time we chatted or how is that coming that I'm still interested. I have really not done anything. Reason being is very simple. I have been through my personal challenges in the last one and a half years. I don't know whether they're untold or not. I'm going through some medical problems also and I lost my both my parents in one and a half years. So a lot of things going on my personal site. Okay. So I have not done anything and anything if I've been doing is there. Is a company called Branding Brand. I've been helping them a lot in their growth. Okay. Hello? Yeah, I can hear you, buddy. Yeah, okay. Yes. So you guys told me about your parents laws. I'm really sorry to hear that. And that's why I decided when I. Heard about that I was like, okay, I should not be reaching out at this point. Step back. At that point when I heard about. It, I did not know about your health challenges. By the way. Yeah. I'm hoping things get better quickly for you. I wanted to chat like if this is something that you are still interested in, is this something that you would want to pursue still or you feel like you don't have much bandwidth? No, I told her that I will be interested. I was very clear to him that I'm really interested in it. But I really want to see also that I can help the company see at the end of the day, if I want to be associated with someone, I want to help them grow. I want to see them growing. That's the whole purpose. Otherwise helping anybody is not worth it. If you are not going to grow, you're not going to like me. I'm not going to invest my time and waste it. So both ways it's important. So that's why I want to send more from you. Where do you stand? And then we can decide whether it will I'll be helpful to you also or not. Because it's a both way to season. Makes sense. Can I just take this very brief? Just give me 1 second. Yeah. Hi. Yeah. Okay, let me give you some background here. Yogesh. So the idea being that right now we are building out this platform relatively early in our journey. It's been like whatever, eleven months or so that we're building out the platform. Right. The goal for us is to work with about five companies, five large companies total. Okay. Very closely with them solving one or two of their initial use cases and proving value basically. Right. So I told you two that we are already working with. Third that we are getting like we already got connected with is Mark. So Mark is the third one that's in draining us for their MLS needs. Now we are looking for two more companies to work with practically. So that's the state that we are in. The reason being that we have built out a base platform. But we also understand that no matter what we build out, what we think that the company needs, we will almost always be wrong. And what are actual use cases that are needed? How do you integrate with existing systems? All those challenges will come basically when we start working with companies and we just can't handle more than five such companies. Just realistic, as a startup, we don't even need, if you work with five CVSS or five Mercks in the world, I think we are sorted for a decent amount of time basically as a startup. So that's the approach that we are taking so far. And we also understand that given our engineering backgrounds itself, there's practically no way. We can crack these customers. Basically, as you mentioned, we need the type of introductions and the championing that you need to basically get our foot in the door. So actually, all the three companies that you're currently working with, we have found out similar champions who have, like, internally helped us, drive us. And usually these champions are not just like you make an introduction and you're happy with it. You really need to drive this internally because nothing gets done at the right. So that's the general approach that we have. I would love to hear your thoughts on this. No, that's how it will work out. Because, anyway, I told you, it's all about I think other than internal pitch, nothing works out. And you already mentioned one good thing that you want to hand hold it these companies. The biggest thing is that you really. Really need to handle it. Otherwise, it will be always nothing will be done. And right. Third thing, which is way more important. Than this also, is how do you constantly be in touch with the executives. At the top level? Because when you will get engaged, you. Will be engaged at the top level, then you will work at a middle management level or a lower level. But if you lose, connect with the top level. And they do understand that top level is no more interested. You will be lost in entire auction. And nobody will care about you. So that's another piece which is way more important than getting put into it. And even you will be doing hand holding. But last stage is if you do something, how is your work getting propagated up and being shown as a value at a company who is basically that spokesperson for you? You need to always have that spokesperson. Who is doing that. So I think that's the third piece, which you need to be more cautious about. Because first one, everybody will do it for you. Second one, it's your money you are spending in hand holding. How does it matter to other people? Nobody cares about it. Third one is important for you because that is going to generate revenue for you. That is going to generate a long term business for you. So that's the pieces where I think. Is the trick line that makes sense. I'm going to take this advice and immediately apply for the few that we are working with already. Actually. I tell you one thing. This is how I want to start with. If I want to start with at. CVS, I'll start with very clear version. But hey, I'm kind of acting as. An advisory to this company. I have conflict of interest. I'll start with that because I don't have a business for you. Otherwise I can engage business directly with you and I don't need anybody's approval. The kind of money I need to give it to you is like a peanuts for me. So I don't need to worry up to 200 300 kwh. I can sign SW anytime. But if I do that, I need. To have a work for that. I don't have a work which is later to you. If you tell me hey, I can do your chatbot and everything, then I am more than happy to forget about our conflict of interest. First thing we can start with on a chatbot business itself. But I don't think so that's anywhere. Near to your product line. Okay? That's right. Yeah. Otherwise that was the easiest way for me because I have big work in that direction. But I have definitely lot of connect where I can take you, introduce you with the people and also keep yourself. Connected with the things. So, first thing I will start is. How do I get your foot into CVS? Because I believe one CVS is equivalent to actually not one mask. You will be actually equivalent to your five companies. Google. Exactly. Yeah. To be honest, we have 26,000 It staff. So it's a $2 billion plus expense every year. How many companies in the world will be spending $2 billion expense every year? So, data science itself, we have around 600 data scientists. 600 data scientists means there is something wrong with the people you have hired. Okay? Yes. So that's a hard fact. These are the things I will help you. One thing which will be very important, nikhunjes, the investment of the person who applies is like real doer because in this company like CVS, you will get. All kind of I call it as. In Hindi bull button, all kind of button. You will get it. But there will be no one who will take things to the end state and they need real people who can code fast. Right. Literally right now I am hiring a. Lot of individual contributor at a senior director level. Director level because I want that kind of talent. Right. I'm paying big bucks just because I know the truck flies. That how fast you can go. Not about how much you speak. Right. So that help I think is very important. When we place into CVS, I think that is one person whose favorite your superstar that needs to get a light. So that one can get okay, then what we can do together, I think as the next step is we can think about some use cases. I can come up with few use cases for us. Okay. Can this use case be built together? You have to assume that money wise. Once you get into it, whatever you will invest in a cringe, you will make five X of that. You'll never imagine what you will do. Any self putting is a problem. Okay. After that money is like a free flow here. I have never seen any other company in my entire life which can give this much money for you. Of course, basically you will invest nothing. And you'll get a lot of money. Okay. So that use cases we can talk about. I can give you multiple use cases even now if you have time. Like I can think of it, but like example one use case I can think of is this is a billion dollar plus product we can build. Okay. Serious is the number one healthcare company. You know that in terms of a pharmacy, we have maximum number of scripts percentage across the US, which is around 25% to 40% scripts. Okay. Now, what it also means we are dispensing maximum number of drugs. Every drug manufacturer is interested in knowing how did my drug performed. If a customer has an ICD code. Which is a disease code X, and he has five diseases. And when he was taking what he was taking three medicines X-Y-Z what were the symptoms versus if the customer took X y with the XY condition that I took, what was a symptom and. What was the improvement happened in that person? Now, if we can build a business around it, we can take review comments. Because people it's like a product reviews. Okay. You are taking only the stuff because it's a PH. I think you can't take a personality, but you can take the disease course and everything. So that's a big business case. No other company can get you this much better. And if we can build this much. Better than we imagine, how much we. Can give back to the customers and. Also to the manufacturing companies. Make sense? Yeah. Okay. That's the one big business case I see of that what could be built, right. So that's a business case number one in my mind, which is pretty useful. Okay. Okay, then one more business case, which I believe is good, is whole this. Concept which I was asking you, telling. You about a date, simple delivery date, how do you print? Because forget about Ups and USPS has. Fixed, sold everything once it leaves your facility. Okay, right. What has not been fixed or solved is pharmacy world is a big problem. Okay? Yeah. It's not like picking a shirt and. Packing it in the box. It has way more regulations and the processing times are way more complicated. How do you predict that? When will it be shipped? Rather than giving a wrong expectation that I'll ship you after ten days, but actually I'll ship you in three days. Or I say five days and I. Give you after eight days, both could be incremental. And specifically, if you're dispensing specialty drugs where somebody is going through arthritis or some kind of a real disease, terminal disease, you can't be delayed by even half an hour. Okay, so having that prediction model which. Helps customer take up right decision making. And constantly updating them without having a. Systematic basically thinking like not a process, but engine telling it that is another. Business, I think, which is very customer centric. These are two business cases I can think. Those business cases are more of a vision based, so I will not go on that. So these are the two cases I can think in my mind as of now. The first one is way more stronger. And a bigger use case comparatively to second. Although I think the customer impact is more with second. But people don't look at basically everybody looks at a short term benefit, not a long term benefit. The first use case is a real. Money making use case. Second use case is a customer satisfaction. So people will pay more for the. Building a dream rather than building a reality. Makes sense. Yes. So that's the two use cases I can think as of now, on serious side, I can think more. There are two which is on top of my mind. I definitely can think many more. It's not like possibilities are not there to think. Makes sense. Makes sense. So actually one quick question. I do have an investor call soon Yoga. Maybe we can set up a follow up call. But just one quick question. Are any of these two use cases that you mentioned about already getting worked on? Like somebody at least is trying to drive or nobody is trying to drive. Currently, I can tell you the first. One is pretty much at a very. Early stage discussions that do business thinking. Only person who's thinking like this is me. So I'll be pushing the business that. This is what we should build. I see. Okay, so I'm the one who's pushing guy here. Okay, I see. So I basically need to convince you. No, you don't need to convince me. We need to convince you. In this case, I will use you. As an accelerator or a person to say, hey, this company can help us, but let's listen to them how this can be useful. In fact, before that, I will introduce. Them to one more company which has done a similar work so that I will generate the interest in their mind that this is really a billion dollar idea. Because my personal thinking, this is more. Than a $5 billion business line for. CVS if it goes well. Right. So that's what my mindset says. Understood. Okay. So Yogesh, are you available on Friday around similar time to catch up again this Friday or something? Yeah, generally I'm available after 05:30 P.m. East. Very rarely I will have a call till 06:00. After that generally I'm free. 06:36 P.m.? Yest. You can always call me. Generally, no commitment. Okay, understood. Generally I'm based on PST, so actually that timing works very well for me. But right now I'm traveling to India actually to meet my team here. So like a little bit later on est would be better for me if we can do like around this time basically. Would that be okay? Perfectly fine. Okay. What I'll do is I'll send out. An invite to you for Friday and then let's do a deeper dive into it. How can we define some of the use cases? Basically? How do we figure out the next step? I know it's going to be a. Long process, but let's get started now. Yeah, I have a lot of other ideas in my mind already going on, but all we can do so we'll. Talk more as we go. Okay? Awesome. Thank you so much, Yogesh. Yes. Bye.
