Hi, Nick. Hello. Hi, sir. Jim. Hi Nicholas. How are you? I am good, how are you doing? Good, thanks. Nice. Where are you based? Actually currently IBM based out of a city called Merit. Like very close to New Delhi. Okay. Actually, I don't know if you know this or not, but I know your wife. Actually, we did intent together at the University of Toronto. I was going to ask you that question. When I noticed my tax and Toronto and stuff, I was actually going CTO ask the same question to you. In fact, I think we might have a lot of common friends. Right. Do you know people like Muthu KH? Yeah, we are from the same ben, right? Yeah. Ritesh, Palak, Shabami these are like all very close friends to me. Okay. Yeah, like a palak palak was like also very close friend to me. Like during undergrad graduate. But over time we haven't been in touch. But I think last time I talked to him, it has been a while, but I know all of people. Even at Berkeley we were in the same lab. Like Paula certification. I actually did have an internship together at Berkeley and then Paula and I came to the same lab for our masters. Yeah, I would imagine that in the same cohort same internship. You guys know each other very well for that matter. During internship we were kind of a part of the same group. Right. Because what my tech used to do, they will make all the students who are going to internship at the same university, they will make them stay at the same place. So we were kind of at the same place and we did a lot of things together. Nice. I will bring this up to sumit as well. Yes, I will. Nice. Good. And besides that, one of the other things that I noticed that I was very curious about is I was just checking out in England and I noticed that you have overlapping work at Fisher Jordan and Credibly. How did you manage to do that? Actually, I was kind of working for Credibly through Fisher Jordan. So like Fisher Jordan is a consulting firm. So like Credibly hired Fisher Jordan, so I was kind of working for Credit Jordan and then last year I kind of moved away from working for Credibly. Got it. Okay, understood. I see. And you operate out of India only you keep coming to like is the team for Credibly largely in Canada or something? No team is largely in US. So they have three offices. So their headquarters is in Michigan, and then they have another big office in Arizona and then they have a small office in New York. So they are mostly team located in these three spaces. And then they have few people for data science team like in India. And then they have few people for their operations in India. They are based out of punate through another vendor, but they're largely, like, based out of US, and their business is completely, like, confined in US only. Okay, so keep coming to the US. Or do you just mostly operate out of India? What's the senior yeah, it's mostly based out of India, actually. Like, I started from New York office, so I was there for almost a year, and then after that I moved back to India. And since then I didn't visit, so I've been just working built out of India. Understood. Okay. And the data science, you mentioned that data science is largely in India? No, I think at one point, like, it was, but now it's kind of 50 50. Like 50% in the US and 50% in India. Okay, I see. So then you have to do you have to work across hours CTO overlap with your other folks in the US. Yeah, even they are used to this. Definitely. You have to make yourself available for meetings. Right. There might be meetings with the US team in the second half, so you have to make them available for that. And then in the first half, you kind of do your meeting with the Indian folks. And if you have any work to do right, you kind of finish. You work in the first half. Interesting sounds this cross border. Working Gmail is always hard. When I was at Reflection, half of my team used to be in India. And it's like after that you're working in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening, that's what ends up happening. Yeah. So you used to work for Facebook, right? I also worked at Facebook, yeah. Okay. Now you decided to start your own company. I did. How long have you been working on this? Yeah, this is very new. So we started talking about this pretty much this idea, like October last year or so. And then January this year is when we actually started coding things up. So in like seven or eight months that we are working on this, and before this, we did one more startup, actually. The same co founders, Sync, have three people from the same batch. So the three of us decided to build another startup called In Hire. That one got acquired by Info. I don't know if you know, like North Rica parent, basically parent company. So they acquired this, and this is like our second startup together. Yeah, that's great. I wanted to talk to you a little bit about this. We are still fairly early stage, but we're working with a few companies and trying to understand what kind of data science problems they're solving. How do they put their models to production, what does data science and machine learning really mean to them, and what does that tech stack kind of looks like. So I wanted to understand that a little bit. And the goal is CTO figure out if there are some folks whose problem set is closely aligned to what we are working with. So we are actually being very because we are an early Shane startup, we don't have like a huge breath of like problems that we're solving. So we're being pretty selective about it. Like these are the people who are solving similar set of problems. So maybe potentially we could work together. So just iguana I wanted to understand that. What kind of problems are you guys solving? Yeah, so just to give you some background about Credibly, right? So as you might have seen, Credibly is a fintech company and they are in a commercial lending space. So what Credibly does like Credibly kind of provides loans and MCAs to small medium owners, right? So it is just a typical lending business, but it is more digital. So the way process flows, right? For Credibly, first of all, Credibly has chris something called broker or agents through which Credibly acquires customers. That is kind of the main channel that Credibly has for customer acquisition. Credibly does have internal sales team, but I think in this space, I think this agent's network is so strong like it just becomes difficult for to have internal sales team to grow and be successful at the same level as this agent channel sgoel, credibly and even I know about other companies in this space as well who have the same issues. Like they are unable to grow their internal, they are also relying on external agents and as you cloud guess, right, whenever they are funding with any of these lenders, they are charging huge commission. One big issue in this space is this customer acquisition, right? Like how to reduce the cost of customer acquisition. And that is kind of on the customer acquisition side because right now I can take a step back here, right? Because you may also ask what is the difference between lender like Credibly versus lender like MX or Chase big bank, right? Why customers are coming to Credibly? Like there are major two reasons for that. One is the generally banks, right? They are highly selective when they are approving someone for a loan, right? So generally they are called prime lender. They only cater to prime customers. You should have a really good credit history in order to be eligible for loan from a bank like MX, right? But now like you have a huge segment and that sometimes I'll go near prime, sub prime, right, depending on in which spectrum you like on the credit scaler. So if those customers like they can't get loan from banks, they will come to lenders Credibly. And now as you could sep since lenders like Credibly are getting to this segment, so they are taking more risk, so there will be a penalty for that. Right? So the major difference which comes here is like interest rate that lenders like Credibly will charge, it will be higher than the interest rate that you will get from bank, right? I think right now, the inderjeet rate that you will get from banks, I think it used to be around 4-5-I think it might have increased to six 7% right now. But from a lender like Credibly, your interest rate could vary from 40% to 100%. It's a huge increase. So it is a highly profitable business. Like you are taking more risk. But if you're good at credit decision, you can make a lot of money in this space. So that is one difference. And second difference is since like banks, right, I don't know if you had taken more days, you may know it usually take four CTO six weeks to even get approval, right? And it is a highly rigorous process. Since it is a highly rigorous process, that means processing times are huge. And then second is like underwriting costs are huge, right, for this big bank. So as a result, they can't originate it's more dollar amount. Generally they would prefer to originate or fund big dollars, like more than million dollars or more than at least 500 kwh. But on the other end, like lenders like Credibly, right? Like things are more digital. It's not as rigorous as banks have. So they are able to generate smaller size loans and they are able to provide the loans more quickly. And that is also a requirement sometimes from this customer. Because let's say you are a restaurant, right? And you decide, okay, I need to buy this equipment to kind of start selling, let's say coffee, right? So you want that money as soon as possible, right? You can't wait four to six weeks. Sorry. Yeah, so you can't wait for four to six weeks. So that's why even timing matters for lenders like Credibly in this space. This is one thing that you have to be really good at. Like how can you have approval as soon as possible. So these are the two major differences between a lender like credit versus lender like Chad or MX. Okay? Now, coming to customer acquisition part, as I said, these are subprime customers. Generally they don't have good presence, right? So you can't completely rely on digital marketing. Like you still have to rely on the conventional marketing, like email, physical emails and phone calls, right? So that's why customer acquisition becomes an issue in this space. So that's why lenders like Credibly in this space, generally they rely on this agents or brokers. Okay, so let me pose here. Do you have any questions so far? Or anything you want to fix? This makes a lot of sense. Are you familiar with the company called One Code? One what? One Code. No. Okay, so we actually work with them. They are also in a very similar space. I think they target India market though, where they are like agent led lending, basically. So that's the business that they're doing. But this Shane seems familiar for that reason. But yes, I'm totally with you. Go ahead. Okay, after that. Now let's say once you receive the application from this broker, right? So after that you start doing your underwriting process, right? And now like thing is you want to as I said, processing time is very important. So you want to automate as much as possible. But these are not prime customers. Like they don't have really good credit history or they don't have really good web present. So you have to do also a lot of manual work as well. So I think different people might have different views. In this space you can find lenders who are completely automated, but the people who run Credibly, they have a different view. They believe in hybrid underwriting process. Some part is being done by automation through robots and then some part is still being done by manual underwriting or through human. And they want at least certain deals to get us by human even right now. Okay, so in the automation side, one thing that generally people are working in this space is you need to parse the data, right, from different sources. Like for example, different type of data sources that in this sales people generally use. Like you will have application data which is generally very simple to get because it is based on your internal system. Then you also rely on some external sources as well for soumen credit bureau data, or web data, social media data, and then you also pull some public report data from the religious businesses are supposed to be registered with Secretary of the State, I don't know if you are familiar with that. So they need to have a good report with them, like some bankruptcy. So this type of data you need to pass. And then other things is since these are commercial loans, you also want to know the health of the business as well, right? Through their cash flow, like how much revenue they are generating. So you sometimes get access to their bank accounts, you sometimes get access to their tax returns, right? That is one space maybe, I don't know if you guys are already working on it or not, but like how this parsing the bank statement data, right, or this cash flow data can be automated right upon lender. That could be a really interesting area because I think this is one area, I don't think it's fully solved right now. So there's a manual touch involved in this process and also there are different challenges are involved. Because if you want someone to access into their cash flow, right, you can do two things. Either you can just get the PDF file from them, right, and you can kind of pass the data yourself. Second way is like you somehow get access to their bank accounts through different channels, right? So generally in this space, business owners, they prefer the first way they are okay to provide you PDF files of their bank statement and you just pass the data from there. But there are also some good customers who are also okay with the second way through which they will give you access to their bank accounts and you have different platforms for that. And then you pass the data. These are the different channels and you're passing the data. And once you're part of the data, then you also try to pick up different signals from there, right? Say for example, from when you're looking at the cash flow data, you want to sep how consistently they are generating the revenue, if there are any bad signal yellow flags in the banking statement, if they are, let's say, negative days or like overdraft fee or something like that, or if deposits are increasing or decreasing. Right, so you want to get these signals. And similarly on the credit bureaus, you want to see how good is the credit history of this merchant or from social media. It doesn't make sense for all the industry, but professional industry, you may want to have them good social media presence. Like for example, generally, at least in the younger population, if you want to go to a restaurant, you will always check Yelp, right? And you will make sure that they have good Yelp rating, right? So you want to make sure that this restaurant is consistently getting good reviews, good rating on Yelp, right, so sometimes it is kind of industry dependent on which social media or which platform you want to look at. Right? So these are kind of on the data exception side and data manipulation side. Let me stop here in case you have any question or anything you want. Me to put deeper right here. I have a question. So you mentioned that the approach that category is taking is kind of hybrid, where soumen part is done automated, some parts done by human in the loop kind of a thing. And then in terms of automation, like one point that you called out was around data parsing from these different sources. So are you guys already using a tool that automatically passes data and like the standard datta format from these sources or is it something that you're saying that you want to use? Yeah, some of them is already in place. For example, we have a third party vendor who kind of automatically parts the cash flow data from the bank statement. So we have a tool there. And then similarly this credit bureau data, it is kind of very well established field. So like already like the player that you buy this data from, like they already give you data in a structured format. Okay, but like for example, social media data or web present data or this public report data, right, even though there are tools out there, but I feel either they are not very accurate or they are very costly. Right? What kind of things are not very accurate or costly? Sorry, the data extraction from social media or their presence. I see. So for that, like data extraction from social media and web, do you work with vendors for that or do you use rebuild internal systems? Yeah, so right now for that we are doing internally. For example, google, Facebook, they already have their API, right? So we are just taking advantage of that. But the thing is right now that is very costly and also like sometimes even we recently started using this data maybe in a more detail in our underwriting process as compared CTO our previous years. So even it's kind of a new process for us. We are lending, so we did not want to invest a lot of money into this. But even like for example Facebook, facebook has a different tiering system when it comes to Facebook API. So they have a free version, they give you access to very limited things. Then you can go to another level, CTO give you more data and then you can go to them with the premium level. It gives you kind of all the data. Right? We are mostly using three versions of their API. And sometimes here one challenge you have how to find the right customers on the social media, right? Like for example, let's say my name is XYZ, right? And I want to know, I want to know all the social media person for XYZ. So you may get XYZ, you may get XYZ one, XYZ two, XYZ three, right? So sometimes it take a note of effort from a manual underwriting side to even make sure that it is the right customer, right. This matching or the search engine part. Right. I think sometimes Credibly struggles with that. Like how to even find the right customer on the social media or the the right business. Understood. Okay, so the profile matching is hard. Cool. So this is very interesting. Now the second question that I had around these mins I like when you build out actual data science models or machine learning models. Actually, first of all, is there any use case I would imagine that for underwriting or figuring out whether to give loan or not and stuff like that, you would have some models in place, right? Yeah, we do, we have a couple of models for that. Got it. And is that something that you all kind of build out and deploy internally or do you guys use any kind of vendors for that? We mostly develop them internally, but only recently we subscribe to a vendor called Data about, I don't know if you have heard about them. So they are kind of automated machine learning platform. We are currently leveraging them to build our models. Got it. Okay, understood. When did you guys start working with Data robot and what was the main pain point that you thought that was solving? Yeah, so I think it has been a few months and actually the main trigger point for us was actually we recently hired a new chief data scientist, incredibly. And he was working for Data before that. So like he kind of knew Datta about inside out and then he suggested and then we kind of did POC and just make sure that it's adding value for Credibly and then eventually we went with them. Interesting. Okay, got it. So here, were you part of that process? Yeah, I was part of it. This is very interesting to me. So get a robot, like something that we closely track and I am generally very curious of how is that buying decision in the company, in a company like Credibly happens for a platform like Datta robot, what was the problem that you are looking to solve and what was the buying process like? I'm very curious to understand because this is a thing that at some point we as a startup need to get better at key companies. Understanding the space entire process will be very helpful here. Yeah, as you might know, right, I think you have a lot of experience of building models, right? So generally like if you're developing something from scratch, right, first thing is it could be a very long process, right? Because you will start with your data, you will do data manipulation, then you will do your feature engineering, then you will kind of start building your model and then you have to fine tune, right, so that the whole process could be expedited in data report. So you just upload your data and then they have inbuilt feature it will kind of do all the feature engineering for you and then they have inbuilt almost about 1000 algorithms which run in the background and then they will give you the best possible model for your use call today. So definitely that's one of the driving force for this. And second thing is you get a lot of transparency with data robot. Like right now thing is when you're developing from scratch, right, like you have to kind of develop everything from scratch even just for the monitoring the model, right? But with this data robot, like they already have inbuilt functions which allows you to kind of monitor your model performance in a more transparent manner. So I would feel like these are the two main drivers. Like one is like you can build model faster and you can use maybe more, you can San Jose algorithms and you can also use more recent algorithms, right? Because as a person you will be limited how many algorithms you know, right? But they are always adding new algorithms. You can just try all the algorithm that they have, right? And secondly, this thing, you get transparency with Data robot. You can easily see things on a feature label and then you can easily monitor how your model is performing and if you see any issues, you can fix them, you can retrain your model quickly on the platform itself. So these are kind of the few main drivers for Academy to move to Gold. Understood. Do you pay them by the usage of the platform? Like, how many models are you building, how many API calls are you making, how much monitoring are you doing, or do you pay them by the number of people using the platform in the company? Yes, actually, I don't know all the details about pricing, but I think, based on my understanding, I think it's kind of we did a one year contract with them, and it is one type of contract we did with them. And I think, like, I don't know if you have any limitations on the user side, but I think that we have some limitations on the server side, how many servers you can use on a user label basis. But I think it is kind of for one year. I think it based on the time period, not by user or something. Got it. I see, I see, I see. And the budget for something like this, was it under you or did you have to go up and get approval for this? Yeah, credit India, small companies, people from the top, people who are in the executive and CX level, they will be involved even in this type of decision. So, ultimately, first of all, you have to get kind of approval from everyone in the executive, mainly from Cos. Can it be two Cos? And then finally, you need to get approval from like you need CTO approval, like legal approval, and just to make sure that it is kind of legally compliant. And secondly, you need finance approval. I see. Okay. And how long did this process take approximately to get all these approvals? Like approval? I think it's quick. Once you prove that it is adding value right. And they feel like it will be useful, it could be fast, but I guess just doing the POC and just make sure that it is adding value, that took us about a month or so, actually, because I have to go now. I have a hard stop. But maybe if you want, we can pick up this conversation maybe like some other time. Yes, we would love to do that. I would love to follow up a little bito more on this thing. Just one thing. Like you mentioned, it's a one year contract. Approximately. How much how much, like, Credibly ends up paying datta about this one year. Not sure. But actually, I wasn't involved in this process, but I think the data robot has another competitor called Aquarium. And I was kind of negotiating with them. And I think the price that they quote us, I forgot. I think it was maybe like maybe 400K or 500K, something like that. Okay, got it. Understood. Aquarium. Yeah, Aquarium. Okay, cool ticket. I'll look this up and we should definitely set up like a follow up call. I want to learn a little bito more and then also get some feedback on what we're building it, but okay, sounds good. Take care, Chelsea. And then set up another call. Okay, sounds good. Bye.
