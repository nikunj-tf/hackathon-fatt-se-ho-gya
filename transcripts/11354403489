Prompt. Let's see. As a junior then the junior is not very junior, but I'm not a decision maker. So you can dive into the ML side a little bit. Join me. Yeah, thanks. She's here. Okay. Hello. Hello. Hi, Rashmi. Hello. Hi, Rashmi, nice to meet you. Can you hear me, Rashmi? Yeah, I can hear you now. Okay, great. Nice to meet you. Yeah, hi. How are you doing? I'm doing great, thank you. How about you? Good, actually. Great. Where are you based? Out of ashram. So basically I'm based out of Maharashtra. So I've been working in Bangladesh for about four years now. Initially I was working in Hyderabad and then it's been four years. I joined Netradyne about a year before. Okay, so could you let me know more about True Foundry and yourself as well? Okay, I'll just give a short introduction of myself and then andravin appreciate so basically about myself, I did my chemical engineering from It Khadatpur post that I was working with McKinsey and Company as a management consultant and I joined through Foundry about four months back. I'm looking at product majorly here, so that's about me. And why would you want to give a shot? Hi Rusty. First of all, basically at Two Truefoundry, we are helping companies speed up their machine learning deployment process, whether it's training deployment or deployment of production traffic. So we'll dive into more details later on, but just wanted to set the context there. Right now we are a team of team membershake, myself and Nikunja. We are the co founders. We are looking to work with companies that are scaling up their ML and trying to help them partner with them to kind of see if we can help them in adding certain values to the pipeline and understanding as to how the MLS and that's why this discussion was set up. Brief about me. Graduated from it. Correct 2013 batch. After that, spent six years working with the hedge fund called World Point where I was looking after portfolio management for them. So we used to work with a lot of different data for building trading strategies. Spent three years in Mumbai and then three years between US and Singapore. And then after that founded our first startup together again with the same team for the entire we sold It Twin Foudge and then finally we are now Abhishek C truefoundry over the last one, a little bit more than a year. Just a quick background about him. He was at Facebook for like six years. Posted he led the software engineering site there from a software engineer to later on when he left as a senior staff software engineer. And he led the videos team, the intro team and so on there. And they couldn't just be on the ML site. So that's like a quick background. Yeah, that's good to hear. Yeah, I think now since the context set so that's why basically since we are like a young startup. Right now we're looking to partner with different enterprises and basically trying to understand what kind of problems companies like yourself, which heavily use data science and machine learning are facing in the machine learning pipeline. And just trying to explore if there is any avenue where we can add value possibly to this. In that regard, I would love to understand what parts of the ML pipeline do you look at and how in a broader sense is machine learning use at metadata. Yeah, so as you know, Netradyne has its own products which is basically installed in fleet, wherein it has a different capability of monitoring the road as well as the driver. So it has multiple features. So for example, if you consider the on road, like you have to detect the signals, you have to detect the lane, you have many other detections. And if you come towards the driver detecting the drowsiness of the driver, whether he's obstructing the camera or whether he is sleeping or some other facial expressions. So based on that, there are multiple features. So this comes mostly into deep learning aspects that we consider the data science and machine learning. So here, wherein we do experiment with different deep learning models, we come up, we have our own data set. So that is a strong point of Netradyne where we have developed a huge data set till now. So based on our data set, we keep on training the models, we keep on improving the models. And that when it comes to deployment. And we have different kind of products. So like, we have three different products, okay? One is the NVDI based products and another one is Qualcomm based product. So I just wanted to know, is this being recorded? No, it isn't. Okay, so with deployment side, when we try to deploy the device end, we basically try to fall back with the devices wherein they provide us the deployment pipeline. For example, if you consider the Qualcomm deployment, we have Snappy, so we have the Qualcomm processors being used, so they provide us the pipeline for Snappy. So using that, we deal with the deployment. So that similar thing when it comes to Nvidia, we have Tensor RT. Okay, this is the big. I think the thing was whether it was actually the fire size note taker does kind of take the transcript notes from the meeting. If you want to kind of if you're not comfortable, just remove it from the material. Yeah, that would be great because since it's.
