Hello. Hi, kid. How are you? Good. I thought you'd be calling me. I was waiting for a call, so I didn't know it was a Google meet, but anyway. Yeah. Where are you based? In Bay Area. I recently moved from Boston. How about you? I am in San Francisco also. Okay, nice. Where. East Bay. Currently in Dublin. We were in Mission, Fremont, so we just moved to Dublin. Looking for a house with the market, the crazy stuff, right? Yeah, for sure. Looking for a house in Dublin area. Preferably in East Bay. So mission anywhere from mission to danville. So that stretch pleasant in Dublin. Sand Mission. Okay, very nice. We finally got a house, and we decided to get a house and kind of remodel it. And I feel like such a bad decision because that recent was like, November 2021, and now here we have November 2022, and they're saying the house is still going to take more than four months to get constructed. Okay, where would you buy in San Jose area? San Jose. Got it. Yeah. Sorry. Go Chad Blunt. At least you didn't buy it in the peak. So November 2021 is still okay. Yeah, that is true. So I thought Friday morning would be pretty easy, but I got an 845 hard stop. But yeah, definitely feel free to reach out and we can set up more time if you want to talk, but yeah. So glad we connected and congrats on the funding. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Garrett I basically reached out because maybe I'll give you some context. We are basically friends from ID, correctport. Three people from Karakpur 2013. All three of us went very different routes, like post credit. Like, I came to the US for my masters. My friend Abhishek came to the US for his job at Facebook, and Rod went into the fintech industry. He went to a hedge fund called World Quant, and he operated out of New York and Singapore, basically. So then we went very different routes, and then eventually our paths aligned and we decided to build a company together. So we first built out something in the HR tech space. That company got acquired by Info H. And after this, when we're building that company, we realized a lot of issues around machine learning models, building deployment, et cetera, without the kind of tooling that I have a privilege at Facebook, basically. So that's where this thought came in our mind that, hey, we can potentially solve this problem. We come from the background where we built and use these systems, and we sep that. There's a huge challenge where people have not invested quite heavily in building out their internal machine learning platforms. Generally, the speed of delivery of models and basically time to business, I guess, is very slow. So that's why we decided to solve for this problem. And now we are still relatively in early stages of our journey. It's been only like one year that we started this company. But as you know, recently we announced the funding. We are starting to work with a few very large companies. Like you know about Synopsis? Yes. To live close to the Boston headquarters, boston branch of Synopsis. It's a semiconductor. Yeah. They make a software for the semiconductor. Yeah. So we recently got a chance to work with some very large companies and we have basically reached a point where we have identified that what we have built out and what we are building is adding value to companies. And now pendo up looking forward to working with figuring out if there are kind of scaling it up like working with more companies. And the way we are doing this carried is a design partner mode as opposed to like a customer mode, if that makes sense. I don't know. Are you familiar with the term design partner? I guess you are cocreating stuff or. Is that yeah, exactly, cobuilding stuff. For Swami, Synopsys has these five problems that they're trying to solve out of which maybe three are well within our domain area. For these three we'll build out the right set of integrations so that it becomes super effective for them. It's not like take it or leave it kind of thing. It's like we actually work with you so that you can derive business value out of it. So that's the mode in which we are working with companies right now. And I honestly don't have much context about green dot. Like I went and looked up online, I went and saw some videos. What kind of problems you are trying to solve like cloud and tech, et cetera. So I built some understanding and I thought that it would be nice to learn a little bit more. So that's why I reached out to you to ask for this, I guess. Yeah, sure. So I was at John Icock in manual life, right? So I mean platform, it was much larger organization there, but it's a pretty old firm. So it was lagging in all this infrastructure. So Green Dot is slightly advanced, obviously not matured as like the tech firms, but it's much mature than the insurance division, insurance firms and IBM in fintech startup within Greenhouse to the go to bank. So the goal is essentially to scale the product. Right. From machine learning standpoint, where we are focusing is all about lead scoring. Again, you start from descriptive prescriptive to predictive to prescriptive. Right. So since we started last year, we have moved little more into predictive space in fraud detection and marketing analytics. And I would say those are the two areas and obviously there is NLP related to customer satisfaction and everything, but I'm trying to build out the team with respect to these areas. It's more advanced in the fraud detection and marketing analytics. Those are two key areas. I mean, in terms of what we can do next. Really. Right. So if there was a platform. Essentially every problem we have to start from scratch. Sorry, I lost you. So you said in terms of what we can do next and then I lost you. Yeah. So we have to start from scratch. Right. Based on the problem, figure out what data we have, what is architecture. For example, if you want to build next best action models personalization. Right. I mean, there is the data piece, there is the model piece, there is the platform piece, but there's also the ability of our end app and software engineer resources. So all of those things need to be taken care of. But really I don't think we have sort of a pretty good I mean, we are an AWS shop, so all the predictive modeling is being done on that. So we are able to deploy. I mean, it does need some It support. It's not that easy and prevalent in understanding the deployment piece, unlike Facebook where you guys have had solid frameworks and you would have tons of machine learning engineers. Right. So it's not there yet. It's not mature in terms of machine learning from that standpoint. But we do have some production loads running across the business. I see. In terms of models in production currently, roughly, if you have to guess roughly how many models would be there in production and also what's the size of the team? Yeah, across the enterprise, probably. I would say there are handful key models, but it depends what is production. Right. I'm building a model every other week for lead scoring, which is a different use case. So it's kind of in production. Right, but it's not like being real time scoring. If that's your difference, then there are like handful where we are doing real time scoring or inference. Makes sense. Makes sense, yeah. Okay, I see. And how about the team size kit? Team size is pretty small. I mean, enterprise wide, I would say there's only a handful of data scientists. IBM trying to grow my team right now I only have one analytics person and a data scientist. So we'll get a data scientist. So again, we just started last year, so the team is pretty small on my side, but there are a few other data scientists on other business units. I see. Okay, got it. I kind of got the sense when I was going through the LinkedIn and some of the videos online. So it seems like that the business is decently mature in terms of the tech, like at least some clustering based models that are getting built and stuff. Right? It's more advanced than clustering. I would say clustering is probably the early start. It's little more advanced, I'd say you have XD boots and predicted classification models that are in real time inference. Right. And some are really mission critical as well. A couple of models, they are pretty advanced. Again, in banking space, everything needs to be validated through your risk management. So there is a mature risk management unlike insurance and Manualizing John Hancock, where they were trying to build out that area, that was one of my roles to build out like model risk management space. But banking, you need to have it from day one. I see. You can't just deploy any models. Right. It has to be debuted. Makes sense. And at this point, what is your personal success criteria in the company? Like what are you trying to build out? What are you trying to achieve? As I said. Right, so I've done this at man left, John and C***. It's all about scaling the product so the problems you solve at the beginning are different as the product matures. So at the end of the day, I want to scale this product so any models that will help. But at the same time as we get mature, it goes into user experience. So anything like an express action. There's a lot we can do on our unstructured data but we are focusing more on acquisition side and then comes the customer experience. So personalization next best action recommendation. So more prescriptive. Right. So we are in kind of in that predictive space still because the predictive models itself are mission critical right now. Some of the recommendation algorithms, you can get the value but it's not tangible sometimes to the business. Right. So how do you know your recommendation? Actually, sometimes if they buy a product, it is easy for them to analyze and understand. But the challenge with some of the customer experience problems is the value is kind of intangible. It might increase your NPS, but how do you say the NPS led to sales? Yes, that is true. I see. Yeah. And I guess in achieving this, building out these personalization models, scaling up the platform, building out the customer experience part, what's the biggest challenge? I guess we don't have decent structure. I would say there is definitely some work needs to be done on our internal architecture. We have redshift. First of all, the data piece is great compared to what we had in John Hancock. So then that's more from a data where I was thinking, but from a machine learning feature standpoint feature store. And then the abilities for machine learning engineers to work together across the enterprise is what you can build out and then deployment of these models and logs. So there's a lot of things that come into play but we are still early sales for that. Okay, I know you have to go soon, so I don't think I can ask you more follow up questions. But I would love to do a deep dive on this if you are up for it sometime next week. Yeah, I'd like to understand more about what exactly you guys are doing. So next week, maybe a little try the week after. We're doing our planning for next time we have board meetings. So next two weeks. Next week is a little crazy, but the week after, I should have some time. Okay, good. I will follow up with you. And by the way, one last question. Are you still playing cricket? I noticed on your LinkedIn that you. No, I stopped playing cricket a while back. I played soccer. Okay. Yeah, I came to karakur for cricket, actually, in the right. Good. I have to start this call, so. We'Ll chat a little bit more later. Bye.
