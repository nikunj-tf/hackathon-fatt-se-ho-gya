{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the call?", "completion": "uuid: 12339399214 To discuss Truefoundry, Nick's background and the challenges Dr. Anish is facing in data science at Doctor Edison."}
{"prompt": "What is Nick's background?", "completion": "uuid: 12339399214 Nick comes from a machine learning background, used to be at Facebook where he built out a lot of conversational AI models for them. Prior to that, he was at a startup called Reflection based in the Bay Area. And he did his masters at UC Berkeley and undergrad there too. Between quitting Facebook and starting Truefoundry, the three of them did one more startup in the talent space that got acquired by Info Age."}
{"prompt": "What challenges is Doctor Edison facing with regards to data science?", "completion": "uuid: 12339399214 Availability of clean data which has been some bit of barrier for them to deploy a few of these models as well. Governance with regards to reviewing the efficacy of the models and improving the models over time."}
{"prompt": "What is Truefoundry?", "completion": "uuid: 12339399214 Truefoundry is a platform to help analytics and machine learning data science teams to operationalize models and their data pipelines."}
{"prompt": "What is the cost of setting up a POC with Truefoundry?", "completion": "uuid: 12339399214 $5,000."}
{"prompt": "How can they set up a POC with Truefoundry?", "completion": "uuid: 12339399214 They need to define a scope of the problem and then they can take one of two directions \u2013 either a lightweight POC or a more integral POC with their DevOps team."}
{"prompt": "How is Truefoundry different from DataRobot?", "completion": "uuid: 12339399214 Truefoundry has built out a tool where they can take the data that is segmenting it and working out what are the most common failure areas in the study. So they can recommend different problem areas and corresponding fixes that helps improve the model. Some part of this has already automated in the tool that data scientists can do by themselves."}
{"prompt": "What is the cost of doing a POC with a very small check?", "completion": "uuid: 12339399214 It doesn't matter so long as there is one check associated with the POC."}
{"prompt": "What is the next step for Dr. Anish?", "completion": "uuid: 12339399214 He will discuss the scope of the POC with his data science team and bring it up to the leadership team to figure out logistics. He will also meet with Nick in-person while he is in Hyderabad."}
