{"prompt": "What are the systems in place for reverting to a previous version of the model and reproducing results?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 Back population systems are in place to facilitate these tasks if necessary."}
{"prompt": "What is the platform that will be overviewed and demonstrated?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 The platform is not explicitly named."}
{"prompt": "What is the speaker's job title and what was their previous experience?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 The speaker is a machine learning engineer. They previously led a conversational AI team at Facebook where they worked on building machine learning models using that platform at the learner. Their work mostly dealt with NLP, NLU, and ASR."}
{"prompt": "What are the three primary areas when it comes to deployments on the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 The three primary areas are services, jobs, and models."}
{"prompt": "What are services in the context of deployment?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 Services are long-running API endpoints that can be deployed on the platform."}
{"prompt": "In what ways can the services be deployed?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 Services can be deployed as a model API endpoint or as any arbitrary Python code."}
{"prompt": "What are the jobs on the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 Jobs are batch inference or model training jobs that run once."}
{"prompt": "How does the platform handle version control for deployments?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 All deployments done through the UI are translated to a format that is tracked on a user's GitHub repository. Each deployment version is also associated with that specific deployment."}
{"prompt": "What are some ways that the platform allows for experiments to be tracked and compared?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 Experiments can be tracked as tables which include information on metrics and hyperparameters. They can also be compared by checking against each other as well as against older versions."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the model registry?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 The model registry holds all the different versions of a model, including metrics and usage with the ability to see schemas and metadata for each."}
{"prompt": "What are some of the differences between the platform and ML Flow's features?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 The platform goes beyond what ML Flow can offer, allowing for deploying models directly through an integrated UI, logging plots as artifacts and interactive plots, and real-time model monitoring hierarchically from model summary to raw data."}
{"prompt": "What is an area of interest for the listener that they would like to discuss in a future call?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 Monitoring is an area of interest for the listener."}
{"prompt": "What other capabilities does the speaker mention the platform offers besides the primary areas of deployment?", "completion": "uuid: 11773896093 The platform offers an infra allocation layer and compatibility with existing tools."}
