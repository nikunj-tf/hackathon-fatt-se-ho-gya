{"prompt": "What made you choose this problem statement to solve?", "completion": "uuid: 12339422352 There were three events that led us to believing this problem is still unsolved. The first was building a horizontal level platform and realizing once a company goes beyond a certain scale in machine learning, things need to be platformized for efficiency reasons. The second was working at Facebook and noticing the amazing features of their platform that trivialised building, deploying, and maintaining models. The third was building our own machine learning models while doing another startup and realizing that doing it with existing tooling still involves a lot of pain and does not get far enough as machine learning matures. We believe it's important for machine learning to follow the same paradigm as other software in the long term and for good practices like version control and automatic rollbacks to be maintained."}
{"prompt": "What is the direction in which you believe the problem has still not been solved?", "completion": "uuid: 12339422352 We believe that machine learning needs to follow the same deployment paradigm as other software instead of a completely parallel setup. Also, good practices like version control and automatic rollbacks need to be maintained to avoid machine learning becoming unmanageable as it becomes more mainstream."}
