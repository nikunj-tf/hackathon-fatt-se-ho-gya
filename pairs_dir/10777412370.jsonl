{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the call?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 In the context of the startup that you're building, the purpose of the call was to understand IBM spending a lot of time talking to practitioners, understanding their current workflows, how are they building and deploying models today and where do they see that there are currently some gaps that exist in the workflows."}
{"prompt": "What is Shane's background?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 Shane comes from a machine learning background. Prior to starting Truefoundry, he was at Facebook where he was leading one of the conversational AI efforts. Before that, he worked quite extensively in the e-commerce domain."}
{"prompt": "What kind of interactions does Shane want to do directly from their desktop?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 Shane wants to build their training algorithm in VS code and then fire it off and say 'run training' that goes up and specifies certain instance sizes with specific input and output locations, creating the artifacts and pushing them into s3 in one seamless way."}
{"prompt": "What is productionizing?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 Productionizing basically means deploying the training job somewhere, mostly for them, it will be probably AWS Airflow, which will continuously keep on training while also productionizing their inferences so that every day they take their model, package it into like a Rest API and put it into some AWS container, dockerize it, and put it into AWS container using airflow to invoke it and get output from it."}
{"prompt": "What kind of models is Shane primarily using?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 Shane is using a mix of both classical ML types like Xg boost psychedelarn types, and TensorFlow Python types."}
{"prompt": "What kind of server is Shane not using for the inferences?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 Shane is not using anything like TF server or Torch server, any zoom conference servers for the inferences."}
{"prompt": "What is Shane's response to using some of those servers to speed up inferences and on?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370  Shane is open to using some of those servers, but doesn't have a lot of information about them and needs more information."}
{"prompt": "What is the platform that IBM has built is used for?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 The platform IBM has built is used for DevOps, developers can deploy their models, training jobs, or batch inference jobs on the platform"}
