{"prompt": "What is the game of operationalizing models, according to the speaker?", "completion": "uuid: 11354404209 To monitor the models for drip data response and different monitoring activities and trigger a new AutoML bill if needed"}
{"prompt": "Why did the speaker ask about the stack built around Sage Maker?", "completion": "uuid: 11354404209 To understand why Sage Maker was chosen and if building the ML deployment layer over Kubernetes was considered"}
{"prompt": "Where are the models that the speaker is referring to typically built?", "completion": "uuid: 11354404209 Internally, but for Fortune 500 customers, the models can also be built by the customers using tools like Sage Maker and GCP"}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the platform built by the speaker's company?", "completion": "uuid: 11354404209 To reduce time to value for ML models and provide scalability to allow quick ML model deployments with the flexibility for developers to build on top of it while ensuring right security and other requirements for the industry"}
{"prompt": "Which companies does the speaker suggest to target for their platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11354404209 Chip or health manufacturers who are not hardcore IT companies and not at the level of Salesforce or ServiceNow"}
{"prompt": "What suggestion does the speaker give to improve the growth story of the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11354404209 To get data scientists out of it and enable business users to run AutoML pipeline parallel to the experimentation pipeline"}
{"prompt": "What does the speaker plan to do after scheduling the demo of the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11354404209 Take feedback and learn about challenges and use cases, but partnership with companies like Pega is not possible at the present stage of growth"}
{"prompt": "What is the speaker's opinion on hiring and managing a data science team?", "completion": "uuid: 11354404209 It is a long and difficult process, and enabling business users to run AutoML pipeline parallel to the experimentation pipeline can offset the cost of maintaining a data science team on the company's side"}
