{"prompt": "What type of web server generally works better?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 Right border server generally work better."}
{"prompt": "Have you heard of thoughts of anything along those banks?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 Not at the moment, I would be very open and frank here."}
{"prompt": "What are the challenges that you see with respect to this entire model frameworks?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 Currently, there is some transition going on, and unfortunately, I have decided to move on. So, in that case, I think challenges and everything maybe it will be better for you guys, you know, discuss with the one who will take it over from there."}
{"prompt": "Will all the problems be prioritized at the same time?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 No, the ones which are priority in terms of the business outcomes will be prioritized over everything that I mentioned."}
{"prompt": "Have you decided where you are going?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 Some options. I still need to figure out the best possible from there."}
{"prompt": "Who is going to take over your old position?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 Currently, not somebody from my role for sure. It's going to be somebody within the team who is just a, you know, data science types."}
{"prompt": "What does True Foundry focus on?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 True Foundry comes at the model level. So, we don't deal too much with the data and feature engineering side of things. We do deal with model and beyond Basically, okay?"}
{"prompt": "What is the main thing that True Foundry is solving for?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 The main thing that we are solving for is obstructing away infrastructure in a data science, friendly using data science."}
{"prompt": "What can you do once you put a model to production using the True Foundry platform?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 Once you put a model to production using the platform, you can also get very quick monitoring model monitoring and data drift dashboards as well."}
{"prompt": "What is the objective of True Foundry?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 The main thing that we are solving for is obstructing away infrastructure in a data science, friendly using data science, Friendly APIs essentially."}
{"prompt": "Are you able to quickly deploy the model without making the data scientists deal with infrastructure?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 Yes, technically a data scientist could get an API endpoint directly from the Jupiter notebook."}
{"prompt": "What are some areas that True Foundry is working on?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 We would love to show the product demo as well to you and get some more concrete feedback at some point. So, those are the areas that we are working on."}
{"prompt": "Are you going to continue to work in data science?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 Yeah, I'm into data science. Only I generally like to build products in data science data related products, basically I generally not get biased by ML only stuff."}
{"prompt": "What is your mental model of True Foundry?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 If you think about the data scientist journey from licking building a model, right from left to right? So they typically spend a lot of time and data and feature, engineering and then model training, hyper parameter tuning deployment of the model and monitoring of the model. So true foundry comes at the model level basically."}
