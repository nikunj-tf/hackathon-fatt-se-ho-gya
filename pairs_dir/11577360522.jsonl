{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the call?", "completion": "uuid: 11577360522 To learn from Ricashi about AI functions in healthcare and to discuss True Foundry's current ML stack, use cases, challenges, and goals for the next six months."}
{"prompt": "Who is leading the call?", "completion": "uuid: 11577360522 It's unclear who is leading the call."}
{"prompt": "What is Truefoundry?", "completion": "uuid: 11577360522 Truefoundry is a startup that helps companies move fast with data by testing out and deploying models to production, as well as monitoring them in the right way without much effort needed from developers."}
{"prompt": "What is Advertiser?", "completion": "uuid: 11577360522 Advertiser is a healthcare machine learning company that focuses on pre-operative care and revenue cycle management. They are leading the research and machine learning team and are based in Seattle, USA."}
{"prompt": "What are the unique challenges associated with ML in healthcare?", "completion": "uuid: 11577360522 The unique challenges associated with ML in healthcare include the diversity of users and the use of domain-specific parameters and codes. Clinical decision making needs to be validated beyond just using GitHub workflows and requires a deep understanding of the data."}
{"prompt": "What is the main focus of True Foundry's platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11577360522 True Foundry's platform primarily focuses on the deployment side of ML, orchestrating everything over Kubernetes, making it easy for data scientists and ML engineers to train models, deploy them in a testing environment, and move them to production environment while having complete monitoring."}
{"prompt": "How does one deploy a model in a stateless model versus a model based on certain data that gets pre-processed every day?", "completion": "uuid: 11577360522 Deploying a stateless model is relatively easy, but deploying models that use large numbers of features can be more challenging, as an IT team may be required on the other end to manage the pipeline to ensure data comes in and goes out correctly, even if the clinical user on the other end is less technically experienced."}
