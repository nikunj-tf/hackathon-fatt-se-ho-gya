{"prompt": "What is the platform built using?", "completion": "uuid: 12044331076 The platform is built using Kubernetes, Argo CD, and various integrations such as Streamlit and Jupiter Notebook."}
{"prompt": "How do data scientists deploy models using the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 12044331076 Data scientists can deploy models using a Python SDK or a UI that allows them to click a button and deploy the model for specific use cases like cities or fleets of cars."}
{"prompt": "What kind of ingresses do you use for real-time models?", "completion": "uuid: 12044331076 We use an ingress layer to forward traffic to the thousands of spots running on Kubernetes, allowing data scientists to deal with real-time models in a more efficient manner."}
{"prompt": "How do you manage resource requirements for models of varying intensity?", "completion": "uuid: 12044331076 The cluster is managed by the infrastructure team, but the permissions to play around with the clusters are given to the data scientists. Horizontal port scalar is used to create scale based on CPU and memory usage."}
{"prompt": "How is permission control managed for different users and their respective projects?", "completion": "uuid: 12044331076 The platform has authentication and authorization integrated into the UI. Data scientists log in with Open ID connect and are given a guest role. Permissions are elevated based on project assignments and data set ownership."}
{"prompt": "What are the core problems the company intends to solve in the future?", "completion": "uuid: 12044331076 The company is currently focused on the adoptibility of the new platform. Future plans include trip detection, hyperparameter tuning, and model monitoring, all of which are still in the planning phase."}
{"prompt": "What is Truefoundry's vision?", "completion": "uuid: 12044331076 Truefoundry was developed to solve operationalization problems surrounding machine learning models. After talking to various companies, the team realized that only a few dozen companies in the world could afford to build the kind of platform they were building."}
