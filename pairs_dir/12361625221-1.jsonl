{"prompt": "What is the main workflow of the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625221 The main workflow of the platform revolves around deployment multi model and everything. Basically, you can store for each customer. You can probably create probably a model registry here. These models are basically saved here with different versions. If you want to deploy these models, let's say you've already saved the models, then when you want to deploy, it's up to you based on the use case, you might want to deploy it as a real-time service or you might want to deploy it as a batch inference."}
{"prompt": "How do you deploy models in the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625221 If the model is already saved on the system and you want to deploy, you choose the namespace where you want to deploy. These are the list of all the models that you have, and then you select the models that you want to deploy. You can also select if you want your selected models to target GPU or a certain type of CPU machine. Then you can click on deploy where it will create a service. If you want to deploy from Hugging Face model directly, you can give us the Hugging Face link and we'll automatically deploy it."}
{"prompt": "Is everything driven by API in the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625221 Yes, everything in the platform is driven by API, and all the APIs are exposed that can be integrated into the layer for the customer. So all the UIs are not exposed, just the APIs. At the end of the day, everything is a REST API and we also provide our Python SDK."}
{"prompt": "What is the pricing model on the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625221 We charge customers on the basis of the number of users. For now, our pricing has been USD 300 per developer per month. But we can think of a simple blanket pricing that can work for you all."}
{"prompt": "What are the items that will be deployed on the customer's cluster?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625221 Control plane will get Argocd, Argowork, Istio, and if you need auto-scaling, we need Prometheus. Workload cluster will get Argocd, Argowork, and Istio. If you need long-term persistence logs, you can use Loki; otherwise, you can continue using Azure. Elastic search is also available. Prometheus is optional and only necessary if you need auto-scaling."}
