{"prompt": "What was the challenge with adding external calls and why was it a big challenge?", "completion": "uuid: 12362100552 Most external calls were expected by the models and adding more external calls would add more latency, making it harder to serve features online. This was a big challenge for the team."}
{"prompt": "Are remote calls possible?", "completion": "uuid: 12362100552 Yes, remote calls are possible, but making a remote call for every model call would be too expensive in terms of latency."}
{"prompt": "What is the team's primary focus in terms of feature engineering and A/B testing?", "completion": "uuid: 12362100552 The team's primary focus is feature engineering, serving, and A/B testing."}
{"prompt": "What tools and platforms does the team use for training and serving?", "completion": "uuid: 12362100552 The team uses Databricks notebooks and Spark for training, and their serving layer is built on top of Kubernetes. They are exploring using TF serving for hosting, and are developing Omega ML platform for feature transformations and workflow management."}
{"prompt": "How does the team manage costs on their Databricks clusters?", "completion": "uuid: 12362100552 The team's cost monitoring systems are limited, and they usually look at Azure's cost management tool for monitoring. They do not have any fancy solutions or real-time monitoring of costs for individual jobs."}
{"prompt": "Do the team separate models by different advertisers?", "completion": "uuid: 12362100552 The team trains all advertisers together, and do not have any major concerns about sharing data between advertisers. They are exploring having models for different advertisers."}
