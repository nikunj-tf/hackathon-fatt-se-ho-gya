{"prompt": "What is one of the use cases for the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 10439124882 The platform is primarily used for monitoring data drift and distribution drifts between training and actual data in industries such as real estate, pharma, and tech."}
{"prompt": "What is the target audience for the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 10439124882 Industries that are not very tech oriented and do not have their own data science team, or those who only have one analyst or data scientist are the target audience for the platform."}
{"prompt": "How long does it take for data scientists to start using the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 10439124882 Data scientists can start deploying on the platform within a matter of a couple of hours, making the onboarding process less than a day."}
{"prompt": "How does the platform differentiate from others such as Sage Maker?", "completion": "uuid: 10439124882 Unlike Sage Maker, the platform is user-friendly and not a black box. The platform is easy to use and provides users with the necessary support they need, even if something goes wrong."}
{"prompt": "What is the target strategy for the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 10439124882 It is initially better to have a few, slightly bigger customers for the platform to evolve and make it easier for smaller customers to use it and then distribute it to multiple industries."}
{"prompt": "What is the UI like for deploying a model?", "completion": "uuid: 10439124882 The UI for deploying a model is straightforward and only requires selecting the source, repository, name, and branch, and then clicking deploy."}
{"prompt": "Can the platform accommodate data of different types?", "completion": "uuid: 10439124882 Yes, the platform has a schema for every model that allows data scientists to define the features and associate a type with them. An error will be thrown if the data type does not match the schema."}
{"prompt": "How can the platform be used for model training?", "completion": "uuid: 10439124882 The platform allows data scientists to deploy a model training job by writing Python code, and they can trigger it to run on the infrastructure with one click."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the model registry?", "completion": "uuid: 10439124882 The model registry serves as a central repository for all versions of the model that users have retrained, making it easy to keep track of them."}
{"prompt": "How many versions of the model can users keep running on the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 10439124882 Users can keep running all versions of the model on the platform."}
