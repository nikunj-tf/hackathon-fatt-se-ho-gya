{"prompt": "What is the process of migrating code to creating images or writing Python files?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403912 The DevOps team handles this process, and developers help in deploying all the services."}
{"prompt": "What is the process for promoting from one environment to another?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403912 Staging is promoted to UAT, and from there to Production. The pipeline has already been automated and there is nothing to coordinate."}
{"prompt": "What cluster is the code copied to when deploying in a different environment?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403912 The code has to be copied to a different cluster because everything is different, such as branches and code. Staging may have code which is not supposed to be delivered, so it cannot be promoted to UAT."}
{"prompt": "Is BitMarket or GitHub used for resource provisioning and deployment?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403912 Both are used."}
{"prompt": "How is secrets management handled?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403912 Google Secret Store is used for some services, and something else is used for others. Secrets management is automatically ingrained build."}
{"prompt": "What is the process for developers to deploy to the workspace?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403912 Developers individually deploy services or Cron jobs to this workspace, which can be scheduled or triggered at their leisure. The deployment to the workspace is very simple and can be done through a YAML configuration or UI without the help of DevOps or infringement for the Kubernetes YAML."}
{"prompt": "What is the workflow for data science?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403912 Instead of TML, it exposes the Python way so that data scientists can do it. There are complexities that come into the platform in terms of doing monitoring at the level of data science rather than just system-level monitoring."}
{"prompt": "What is the concept behind the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403912 It is built agnostic to software engineering, and allows you to connect to a GKE account with authentication, access control, and choice of machines. Once connected, you create different namespaces or workspaces for your different teams which come with resource constraints, and allow you to control access."}
{"prompt": "What is the role of DevOps in the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403912 DevOps acts as a security layer and comes into play if anything breaks or if there is a change in a final approval. If you are okay with your developers directly pushing, that is also fine."}
{"prompt": "What is the benefit of the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403912 The platform comes equipped with monitoring logs, secrets management, CI/CD integration to GitHub bit bucket, authentication systems, and rollout to production in a canary shadow testing manner. All of these come by default with the system."}
