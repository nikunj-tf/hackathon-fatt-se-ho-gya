{"prompt": "What is the process of building a model like?", "completion": "uuid: 11655736993 It involves spinning up training resources, comparing web models, testing the workspace, secrets management, authentication, system monitoring, and basic monitoring out of the box."}
{"prompt": "What tools are used for interactive computation and deployment?", "completion": "uuid: 11655736993 Data bricks are used for interactive computation, while Kubernetes is used for deployment."}
{"prompt": "What is the pipeline model builder used for?", "completion": "uuid: 11655736993 It is used to extract one file, put it in a code base, and run a pipeline for multi-cloud use."}
{"prompt": "Who evaluates the models and when is this done?", "completion": "uuid: 11655736993 Business teams with statistics backgrounds evaluate models during the model evaluation phase, which is generally done before the dev environment."}
{"prompt": "What is the process of deploying a model to production?", "completion": "uuid: 11655736993 The engineering team handles the logistics once a model is deployed, while the data science team provides an endpoint for the model."}
{"prompt": "What is data drift and how is it measured?", "completion": "uuid: 11655736993 Data drift is the change in the relationship between the input and the response over time. It is measured by comparing the predictions of the model over time with the actual results."}
{"prompt": "How are new data models ingested by the pipeline?", "completion": "uuid: 11655736993 The pipeline has to adjust to new ways of storing data and it ensures that data is ingested at any given moment."}
{"prompt": "What is the process for managing resources and ensuring cost visibility?", "completion": "uuid: 11655736993 Tags are assigned to each resource, and a cost reporting system ensures that costs can be seen and monitored for the last week."}
{"prompt": "What tools are used for monitoring and tracking performance metrics?", "completion": "uuid: 11655736993 Software engineering uses Graphana and Prometheus for monitoring and tracking performance metrics."}
{"prompt": "What tools are used for deployment, and what programming languages are used?", "completion": "uuid: 11655736993 Python deployment is done with Flask or BentoML, and complex models are done in Scala and PMML. The KPM Columbia framework is also sometimes used for open source models."}
