{"prompt": "Who is Lucky and when will he join?", "completion": "uuid: 11942347136 Lucky is someone who will be joining the conversation and the speaker is texting him to join in a few minutes."}
{"prompt": "What is Anrag's background?", "completion": "uuid: 11942347136 Anrag is one of the co-founders at IIFL Truefoundry. He graduated from IAT Karakura in 2013 and spent seven years working with a hedge fund called World Fund."}
{"prompt": "What is the goal of True Foundry?", "completion": "uuid: 11942347136 The goal of True Foundry is to make it easier for data teams to get access to a better platform for testing out and deploying models in a scalable way to production with the right security, with the right authentication and with monitoring in building."}
{"prompt": "What is the size of the Data Science team currently at IIFL?", "completion": "uuid: 11942347136 The team has 4 members currently."}
{"prompt": "What is the current workflow for data to modeling to batch computing to prediction?", "completion": "uuid: 11942347136 The current workflow is to perform extensive exploration data analysis around the data, build models that can be posting and bagging models, and dump the scores in their old database. Prediction is done on the saved models."}
{"prompt": "What kind of API traffic do they expect to see once the models are deployed?", "completion": "uuid: 11942347136 They expect around 10-15 API hits per minute."}
{"prompt": "What are some of the necessities from a deployment platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11942347136 The deployment part should be taken care of, there should be a dashboard for tracking performance and failures in API calls, metrics for tracking population stability index, AUC k or characteristic stability index, and intelligence around retraining the model."}
{"prompt": "Is there a timeline for deployment or solutioning?", "completion": "uuid: 11942347136 There is currently no timeline, but they are exploring possible ways to work towards a solution."}
{"prompt": "Can you provide a demo of how True Foundry works?", "completion": "uuid: 11942347136 Yes, a simple recorded demo can be shown, and a more detailed demo can be scheduled for a hands-on experience with code repositories and deployment processes."}
