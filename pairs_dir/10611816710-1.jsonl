{"prompt": "What is the charter for Junior?", "completion": "uuid: 10611816710 To provide end-to-end infrastructure support for the ML/AI team at Junior, which involves improving the developer experience, post-deploy monitoring and selecting training sets, platformizing all of their orgs, optimizing the cost to run the models, and building a model store for all data points."}
{"prompt": "What are some challenges faced by Junior in terms of their ML/AI processes?", "completion": "uuid: 10611816710 Some challenges faced by Junior include improving the developer experience, building a model store, optimizing the cost to run models, and monitoring the image-based models."}
{"prompt": "What is the company's current usage of Sage Maker?", "completion": "uuid: 10611816710 The company is heavily using Sage Maker operators, which includes training operators and processing operators."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of Sage Maker Operators?", "completion": "uuid: 10611816710 Sage Maker Operators are used by the company to train and process their models quickly and efficiently."}
{"prompt": "What is the objective of building a model store?", "completion": "uuid: 10611816710 The objective of building a model store is to collect all the required data points in one place and derive model lifecycle insights, version updates, and model evaluations results."}
{"prompt": "What is the biggest challenge in getting everyone on the same platform at Junior?", "completion": "uuid: 10611816710 The biggest challenge is to convince everyone to switch to a unified platform instead of using their own existing infrastructures and processes."}
{"prompt": "What are the challenges in monitoring image-based models and how can they be solved?", "completion": "uuid: 10611816710 It is difficult to detect drifts in image-based models due to camera changes. Research effort is being made to automate this process. Solutions can also involve optimizing models for specific hardware like Arm and incorporating signals to automate retraining pipelines."}
