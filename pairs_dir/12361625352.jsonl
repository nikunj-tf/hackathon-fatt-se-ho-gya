{"prompt": "What did Cinema do before joining Found?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625352 Cinema worked as a management consultant at McKenzie for IT."}
{"prompt": "What is Pritika Groal's role at Medtronic?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625352 Pritika Groal is leading data sciences and digital innovation at Medtronic, part of diabetes organization."}
{"prompt": "What challenges are faced regarding unifying the workflows?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625352 Challenges include misalignment of the process, differences in the integration to the development cycle, and differences in tool sets."}
{"prompt": "What are the challenges faced for scaling and deployment of models?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625352 Challenges include ensuring that resources are not wasted, and a pipeline is set up to follow FDA guidelines strictly."}
{"prompt": "What is data identification and why is it necessary?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625352 Data identification is separating personal identifiable information (PII) from the rest of the data to prevent researchers and analysts from accessing PII. It is necessary to follow privacy regulations."}
{"prompt": "Who does explainability for models currently?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625352 Currently, most models rely on SHAP values. They are still exploring a good system for explainability."}
{"prompt": "What happens when a model needs to be retrained after going beyond set limits?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625352 The model falls back to the previous version."}
{"prompt": "Are the models for direct customer facing on the hardware or on the cloud?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625352 Currently, they are on the cloud. They are exploring edge computing to get on mobile devices."}
{"prompt": "How is the monitoring done for models when they are on devices and there is no connectivity?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625352 One approach is to run some part of the feature on the device and use cloud for learning and optimizing parameters. Heuristic-based algorithms can also be used to detect patterns on the devices."}
