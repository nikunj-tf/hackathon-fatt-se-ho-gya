{"prompt": "What are the tasks involved in the data science process described?", "completion": "uuid: 10346094649 Tasks involve cleaning data, doing feature engineering, building model, testing model, deploying model, and batch inferences and monitoring for data leakage or performance degradation."}
{"prompt": "What challenges is the team facing in building neural network models?", "completion": "uuid: 10346094649 The volume of work involved in building 400 multi-level, multi-classification models with neural networks is a challenge."}
{"prompt": "What format is used to hand over Keras models to the engineering team?", "completion": "uuid: 10346094649 Keras models are saved in the saved model format of TensorFlow."}
{"prompt": "What is the process of updating features in the model and deploying them?", "completion": "uuid: 10346094649 The data scientists add the feature, retrain the model, update the scripts in GitHub, and then the process flows through the production automatically."}
{"prompt": "What tool is used for monitoring the models built?", "completion": "uuid: 10346094649 It is assumed that Sage Maker is used for monitoring since everything is done in the environment."}
