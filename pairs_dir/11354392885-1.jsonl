{"prompt": "What is mixed precision and how does it relate to OnX runtime?", "completion": "uuid: 11354392885 Mixed precision is a concept that involves using FP16 support to synthetically double the amount of RAM available. OnX runtime efficiently supports mixed precision for better performance."}
{"prompt": "What is the approach to managing multiple models without deploying them one over another?", "completion": "uuid: 11354392885 The approach involves deploying the model as a function on Kserv, incrementally copying one third of it to a multimodal server with GPU backend support. XGBoost provides the inference file format supported by Triton for this purpose."}
{"prompt": "What is the role of OCR model in detecting and recognizing rows and requests in gRPC?", "completion": "uuid: 11354392885 The OCR model detects each row, rotates them if required, and subsequently recognizes the requests using gRPC. This helps in generating multi-people communication for better throughput."}
{"prompt": "Which two types of jobs are used for images and what was the initial use case for Taipei and Lithuania?", "completion": "uuid: 11354392885 The two types of jobs used for images are real-time and batch. The initial use case for Taipei and Lithuania was mostly batch-oriented, but later realized about adequate reserve for real-time use cases."}
{"prompt": "How is model deployment and versioning managed, and what is the role of TensorFlow server in standardizing the inference protocol?", "completion": "uuid: 11354392885 Models are deployed and versioned using CASER, with versions automatically stored for every model. TensorFlow server and Python service are used to standardize the inference protocol for different frameworks. The model deployment is powered by CASER, and TensorFlow server is used for every framework."}
{"prompt": "What is the role of snowflake and feature store, and why was Firebase replaced with fees?", "completion": "uuid: 11354392885 Snowflake acts as the data warehouse, which is updated at a frequency of 15 minutes. Feature store compiles static data by policy and serves load functions. Firebase was replaced with fees due to scaling limitations."}
{"prompt": "What is the main reason behind not using Vertex, and how is the deployment of the system managed?", "completion": "uuid: 11354392885 The main reason behind not using Vertex is its cost effectiveness and scalability issues. The system deployment is managed using knative, Triton, and cloud run for better performance and routing specific payloads."}
{"prompt": "What is the thought process of the tech team while repurposing models for different use cases, and how is testing of the system done?", "completion": "uuid: 11354392885 The tech team focuses on repurposing models for different use cases, and testing of the system is done by debugging the detectron model and converting it to tensor RT for better scalability and efficiency."}
