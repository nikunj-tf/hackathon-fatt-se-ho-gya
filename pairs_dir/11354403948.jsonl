{"prompt": "What kind of problems are you working on and what are the challenges that you are currently trying to solve? ", "completion": "uuid: 11354403948 The current focus is on building the tools for data scientists to efficiently process data for machine learning tasks. The challenge lies in building an efficient data pipeline from the database to the analytic machine to allow for sampling and feature engineering. We also need to consider distributed training and parallel computing for scalability."}
{"prompt": "Who are your target customers and what is the application of machine learning?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403948 Our target customers are data scientists who have knowledge of machine learning and encoding. We provide a Python library to import and then they can train and deploy their own models on their own infrastructure. Our next phase is to provide a cloud infrastructure to train the models and provide verticalized solutions for specific use cases like fraud detection and recommender systems."}
{"prompt": "Are you planning to be cloud-agnostic or focused on one specific cloud provider?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403948 We are planning to be cloud-agnostic and have already deployed our database on the big three cloud providers. We will prioritize which provider to integrate with first, most likely GCP."}
{"prompt": "In the first phase, how does the library integration work with the client's infrastructure?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403948 In the first phase, clients would need to have their own infrastructure for training and deployment. The Python library will be provided to the clients so they can import it and then they would train and deploy their own models on their own infrastructure."}
{"prompt": "What kind of timeline are you looking at for deploying machine learning models and hosting them?", "completion": "uuid: 11354403948 The first phase is already complete with the Python library provided to clients. The next phase of providing a cloud infrastructure to train the models and building hyper-parameter tuning and parallel computing capabilities will take at least half a year. Verticalized solutions for specific use cases like fraud detection and recommender systems will be a parallel focus."}
