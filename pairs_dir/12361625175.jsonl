{"prompt": "What is the goal of Truefoundry?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625175 The primary goal of Truefoundry is to enable companies that are on multi cloud architecture to build good, flexible, machine learning deployment platform on top of that and solve for other parts or pieces of the problem that comes with deployment."}
{"prompt": "What is Peter's position at Novartis?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625175 Peter works as an ML engineer in Novartis."}
{"prompt": "What are some of the challenges that Peter faces in his job?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625175 Peter faces the challenge of redundancies that get created because different teams work in silos, making it difficult to aggregate data from different sources. They share no code or solutions across departments, and different teams may build the same thing in parallel."}
{"prompt": "How many ML engineers work closely with Peter?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625175 Peter works mostly with two ML engineers, but he also cooperates with around ten software engineers and probably 20 data scientists."}
{"prompt": "What tools do Peter and his team primarily use for deployment?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625175 Peter and his team primarily use AWS solutions, such as Sage Maker jobs, Lambda functions, and ECS."}
{"prompt": "Does Peter work on real-time models as well?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625175 Peter is working mainly on batch models for internal consumption. However, there are some plans about real-time models as well."}
{"prompt": "Does Peter's team use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625175 Peter is not aware of any use of Kubernetes by his team. He personally has no admin access to EKS, but other teams in Novartis may use it."}
{"prompt": "How many ML models does Peter's team support?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625175 Peter's team supports a few thousands of models, but each is responsible for some single time series, and they are usually very small models."}
{"prompt": "Does Peter face any challenges with permissions or services quota?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625175 Peter mentions that it takes several months to get approval for some additional permissions or to extend service quota for a particular service. So, he tries to do as much as possible on his own and builds a workaround rather than getting permission."}
{"prompt": "Does Peter see a need for multi-cloud at Novartis?", "completion": "uuid: 12361625175 Peter feels it's easier to have everything in one cloud, and he has not seen any clear need for multi-cloud at Novartis. In his experience, it's easier to communicate between AWS services or Azure services."}
