The structure is diverse, and there is no central infrastructure as such. The different business pods are doing AIML in different ways."}
{"prompt": "How is the research infrastructure at Novartis managed, and how are models deployed and maintained at scale?", "completion": "uuid: 12044422255 There is not much clarity on how the research infrastructure at Novartis is managed, but for the central team, they use glassbox primarily, and the data pipeline is built using GUI with little bit of coding here and there. The challenge faced by Novartis in deploying ML models at scale is that the business side doesn't fully see the promise yet, so the focus is on solving the right business problem, and there is no proper data management in place."}
