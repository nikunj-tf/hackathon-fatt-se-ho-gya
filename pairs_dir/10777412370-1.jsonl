{"prompt": "What can be tracked while the job is running?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 CPU memory, network usage, and logs of the job."}
{"prompt": "How are different versions of the same model tracked?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 All runs of the same model can be tracked through different versions and it is easy to see which version of the particular job ran when."}
{"prompt": "Can previous versions of a job be redeployed?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 Yes, redeploying a previous version is practically just a click away."}
{"prompt": "What is the developer experience like with this platform?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 Developers can run jobs from their local machine and leverage the power of the cloud. Creating a job object, providing the name of the job and command, and hitting job dot deploy can create a docker container from the training script and run the job on a remote cluster."}
{"prompt": "On which cluster will the job be run?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 The job will run on the Kubernetes cluster that is linked on the platform dashboard."}
{"prompt": "How can infrastructure specifications be specified for a job?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 The type of machines can be specified for a cluster and a workspace. You can specify the type of machines you care about and the pool of machines for your cluster will be selected from this specification."}
{"prompt": "Are machines always running?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 No, machines only exist as part of your cluster and are only spun up and used when a job is scheduled to run."}
{"prompt": "Can performance metrics be tracked for machine learning models?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 Yes, you can track a lot of metrics on the platform dashboard, such as the configuration, metrics, training graphs, and distribution of the data set."}
{"prompt": "What is the histogram graph showing?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 The histogram shows the distribution of a feature across the training and testing data sets. The x-axis is the range of values for a particular feature and the y-axis is the count of data points within that range."}
{"prompt": "Can artifacts generated by a job be tracked on the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 10777412370 Yes, all files and artifacts generated or used during a job can be tracked on the platform dashboard."}
