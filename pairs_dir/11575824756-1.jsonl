{"prompt": "What was causing pain points with deploying ML models to Kubernetes?", "completion": "uuid: 11575824756 The approach being used for other types of applications was being used to deploy ML models."}
{"prompt": "What was the previous approach used to deploy ML models?", "completion": "uuid: 11575824756 Models were packaged into Jupiter notebooks and then handed off to someone who would create a PY file and understand the code."}
{"prompt": "Why was the previous approach problematic?", "completion": "uuid: 11575824756 Assumptions were made in the notebook that were not necessarily true in the production or development environment, causing problems and requiring extensive diagnosis."}
{"prompt": "What is the current approach to deploying ML models?", "completion": "uuid: 11575824756 Using a clean API to handle preprocessing, inference, and post processing, with a library approach and a very organized and fast process."}
{"prompt": "Where are the fitted model artifacts being stored?", "completion": "uuid: 11575824756 The artifacts are being stored using the ML Flow model registry and stored on S3 backend."}
{"prompt": "How often are models in production updated?", "completion": "uuid: 11575824756 Not very frequently - the models are only updated if there is an issue and are driven by client feedback."}
{"prompt": "What is the main challenge currently faced in model monitoring?", "completion": "uuid: 11575824756 Lack of a solution for monitoring and being very reactive, not proactive, in detecting drift."}
{"prompt": "What is the current strategy for monitoring model performance?", "completion": "uuid: 11575824756 Doing batch audits every so often to track accuracy and F1 scores."}
{"prompt": "What are the current top challenges being addressed?", "completion": "uuid: 11575824756 Monitoring and deploying ML models effectively, and finding the right workflow and solutions to address these challenges."}
{"prompt": "Why is Groundspeed looking for external monitoring solutions?", "completion": "uuid: 11575824756 Assumption that there are great tools out there already, and it might not make sense to build internal tools for model monitoring."}
