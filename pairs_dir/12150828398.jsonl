{"prompt": "What is the primary infrastructure that the research team heavily relies on at the moment?", "completion": "uuid: 12150828398 The research team heavily relies on Google Kubernetes engine and Cloud File store at the moment."}
{"prompt": "What is the typical YAML file submitted by researchers, and what does it contain?", "completion": "uuid: 12150828398 The typical YAML file submitted by researchers contains the image they want, the Python packages they need, and specifies the resources they want to use such as GPUs, CPUs, and memory. It may also specify persistent volumes for storing data sets and model checkpoints."}
{"prompt": "How do researchers track their progress and monitor logs and metrics?", "completion": "uuid: 12150828398 Researchers use Kubestl or GCP Console to track their progress and monitor logs and metrics."}
{"prompt": "Is there a limit on how much infrastructure researchers can request?", "completion": "uuid: 12150828398 There are no limitations on CPU and memory requests, but for GPUs there are limits."}
{"prompt": "How does the request for allocation of infrastructure come to your team?", "completion": "uuid: 12150828398 There is no need for permission to request CPU and memory resources. However, for GPUs, there are limitations and the request may need approval from the infrastructure team."}
