{"prompt": "What are the stages that TrueFoundry helps people with in relation to models?", "completion": "uuid: 11942346630 TrueFoundry helps people with the training deployment and the monitoring stages of the model."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the platform that TrueFoundry provides?", "completion": "uuid: 11942346630 The platform that TrueFoundry provides is a place where data scientists or an ML developer can come run experiments on which model works the best."}
{"prompt": "What is TrueFoundry's approach towards deployment?", "completion": "uuid: 11942346630 TrueFoundry covers a wide range in terms of deployment and pays special attention towards different types of deployment like time-sensitive and offline batch inference kind of things."}
{"prompt": "What is the closing the loop part that TrueFoundry handles?", "completion": "uuid: 11942346630 TrueFoundry handles the closing the loop part, which is monitoring the model so that when it starts underperforming, it can be known very quickly."}
{"prompt": "What is the core differentiator of TrueFoundry compared to other platforms?", "completion": "uuid: 11942346630 TrueFoundry is designed to work with existing systems, which means that it fits in well with existing components and only solves parts of the problem that are important."}
{"prompt": "What is one platform that TrueFoundry works well with?", "completion": "uuid: 11942346630 TrueFoundry works well with Databricks because Databricks focuses on the offline and batch inferencing side of things, whereas TrueFoundry's strength is on the real-time inferencing side of things."}
{"prompt": "What is the time frame discussed for a follow-up demonstration of the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11942346630 The time frame discussed for a follow-up demonstration of the platform is mid-fab. A time will be arranged between Robbie and the other party."}
