{"prompt": "Can you explain the testing and performance testing involved for products with AI models?", "completion": "uuid: 10238582319 Manual testing is involved in the testing phase and then the performance testing is done with scripts that put a lot of load on the system to check the throughput and other factors. There are also test cases for each module which measure code coverage."}
{"prompt": "What external tools are used for internal monitoring?", "completion": "uuid: 10238582319 For internal monitoring, Grafana is used to catch all the logs of Kubernetes Pods and to give a view of memory utilization, CPU utilization and more."}
{"prompt": "What information is provided to customers on the admin dashboard?", "completion": "uuid: 10238582319 The admin dashboard talks about the usage, not the infra level metrics of how the system looks like. It provides information like number of API calls, how much they have burned versus how much they had quota for and so on."}
{"prompt": "Are there any external tools used for ML model monitoring, data monitoring, and experiment tracking?", "completion": "uuid: 10238582319 The company uses ML Flow for their machine learning workloads. However, for data monitoring and experiment tracking, it's all custom-built and stored in databases for later retrieval."}
{"prompt": "What is the company's approach to solving problems around data resiliency, reproducibility, scalability, and data privacy and security?", "completion": "uuid: 10238582319 The company solves problems by controlling the system configurations and allowing for one-click deployment to upscale infra as needed. However, they are still working on making their platform completely scale down to zero when no traffic is present, and making it model agnostic."}
{"prompt": "What mode of engagement does the company use with customers?", "completion": "uuid: 10238582319 The company works in a design partner mode, where they pick up one or two problems that are pressing and work with the customer to build out that feature that can be used by the customer's team. They work together with the customer in a weekly meeting or as needed to understand requirements and timelines."}
{"prompt": "What are the next steps in the engagement process with the company?", "completion": "uuid: 10238582319 The next step is for the customer to view a demo of the company's platform. From there, they will identify synergies and discuss potential NDA agreements before moving forward with any partnership."}
