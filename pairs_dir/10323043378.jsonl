{"prompt": "What is the problem with losing clients and how do they want to approach it?", "completion": "uuid: 10323043378 They want to understand the problem and how it is hurting the clients, and also know how the clients have attempted to solve the problem prior to showcasing the capabilities of their product. They will try to have a personalized demo based on the client's specific use case."}
{"prompt": "What is the plan for the demo and what will be sent beforehand?", "completion": "uuid: 10323043378 Before the demo, they will send a document for the client to agree to the setup. During the demo, they will showcase how their platform can add value to the client's existing tools and solve the specific problems they are facing."}
{"prompt": "What are some key questions they want to ask the client during the call?", "completion": "uuid: 10323043378 They want to understand if deployment time is a problem, if the client is using ML Flow and if not, why, how much time batch inference takes, what existing tools the client is using, what business problems they are trying to solve, if they are being crunched on time, and if they are looking to hire more data scientists."}
{"prompt": "What are some comparisons they can make to differentiate their platform from others?", "completion": "uuid: 10323043378 They can discuss their expertise in Kubernetes and how it offers more flexibility for deployment over Sage Maker, as well as the potential cost savings compared to other platforms. They can also focus on specific areas where they excel, such as feature store management and data-driven monitoring."}
{"prompt": "What is the plan for follow-up after the call?", "completion": "uuid: 10323043378 They will keep the client in the loop by sending updates and seeking feedback. They also want to build a community of data scientists for feedback and suggestions on how to improve their platform."}
