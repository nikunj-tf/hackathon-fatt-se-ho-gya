{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the call today?", "completion": "uuid: 9133766297 To understand the problems that the team is trying to solve and figure out if it's a good time to potentially showcase what Trufoundry is working on."}
{"prompt": "What types of models is the team currently working on?", "completion": "uuid: 9133766297 The team is currently working on lead scoring, retention scoring, supply chain optimization, and product recommendations."}
{"prompt": "Are these models already in production?", "completion": "uuid: 9133766297 One of the models, lead scoring, is already in production. Supply chain demand distribution is also in production and the other two models are currently in data engineering phases."}
{"prompt": "Who is currently working in the data science team?", "completion": "uuid: 9133766297 There are four people actively working on the data science team: Nigen, Priyank, Shaans, and Sri Lank. There are two other people, Rohan and Kayhan, who are working on the communications platform and data engineering pipelines, respectively."}
{"prompt": "Does the team have separate engineering support for taking models to production?", "completion": "uuid: 9133766297 It's a hybrid approach. Depending on the need for product help and individual bandwidth, the team either provides data and relies on back end engineers or completes models end to end themselves."}
