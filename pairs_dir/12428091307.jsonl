{"prompt": "Can you hear me well?", "completion": "uuid: 12428091307 Yeah, I can hear you."}
{"prompt": "Who is Nikon and why did he avoid the call?", "completion": "uuid: 12428091307 It is not mentioned."}
{"prompt": "Who is Jimmy and where does he work?", "completion": "uuid: 12428091307 Jimmy works in the founder's office at 200 and has been there for about six months. He mostly works in product and customer development and sales. Before this, he worked at McKenzie as a management consultant and did machine learning in IT. He is mostly interested in NLP."}
{"prompt": "What is the central team structure of data science at Proof?", "completion": "uuid: 12428091307 There is no central team for data science at Proof. The team is mostly associated with the business units and the use cases that have been identified. Each use case has a separate engineering team associated with it."}
{"prompt": "What are the two main themes of business use cases at Proof and are they product specific?", "completion": "uuid: 12428091307 The two main themes are process discovery and document processing. These come under one substructure, but each of them has a separate engineering team associated with them. They are product lines and features."}
{"prompt": "What is the True Foundry platform and what is their main competency?", "completion": "uuid: 12428091307 The True Foundry platform is an ML platform that is cloud agnostic and they specialize in model deployment and everything after that, including scaling, EB testing, and monitoring models in production using data drift tracking and concept drift. They also provide a unified framework to deploy models across clouds."}
{"prompt": "What are some of the core competencies that True Foundry has over open source ML platforms like ML Flow?", "completion": "uuid: 12428091307 Some of the competencies that True Foundry has over open source platforms include role-based access control, secret management, security layer API authentication, and scaling and provisioning resources for managing Kubernetes for the scaling or parallelization of training with GPUs."}
{"prompt": "Does Proof provide a self-hosted version of their platform for clients who are not comfortable sharing their data?", "completion": "uuid: 12428091307 No, Proof does not provide a self-hosted version of their platform. They provide pre-trained models for clients who are not comfortable with sharing their data."}
{"prompt": "How does Proof automate the processes for their clients using robotic processor automation?", "completion": "uuid: 12428091307 Proof automates processes like manual data gathering and processing for tasks like onboarding employees or verification of uploaded files against data using process discovery via screen recording on a laptop."}
{"prompt": "How does Proof deal with data from clients who don't want to share it?", "completion": "uuid: 12428091307 For clients who don't want to share their data, Proof provides a local deployment of their software on the client's system and sends pre-trained models and bots back to the client for inference only. There is no continuous training or retraining happening from the client's side."}
