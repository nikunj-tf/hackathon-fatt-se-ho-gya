{"prompt": "What is the goal of the ML developers platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11655737135 To provide a value add to the business team and make ML developers faster while saving on the cost of building and maintaining."}
{"prompt": "What are the main differentiators of the platform from existing solutions?", "completion": "uuid: 11655737135 The platform is built deeply for the developers, with multiple interfaces for deployment depending on the developer's comfort level, and aims to unify the machine learning deployment process with software deployment process, following the same principles that are followed in software engineering. In addition, the platform aims to make custom plugins building simple and easy."}
{"prompt": "Who is the target customer of the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11655737135 The platform targets both data scientists and machine learning engineers, as the platform is built to meet the skill sets of both and the belief that both will likely use the platform for production use cases."}
{"prompt": "What are the three parts of the ML platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11655737135 The platform has an intra-team interface for creating a secure environment, a developer-exposed interface for deploying services and jobs, a monitoring interface to track performance and detect issues."}
{"prompt": "What are the three types of deployments you can do on the platform?", "completion": "uuid: 11655737135 You can deploy a model, a service, or a job on the platform."}
{"prompt": "What is the metrics visualization process for performance monitoring?", "completion": "uuid: 11655737135 The metrics visualization process in the performance monitoring dashboard includes a hierarchical overview of model performance, with the ability to compare metrics across different time windows and track subsets of data with different log losses to debug model performance issues."}
