{"prompt": "What is the current stack being used by you.com?", "completion": "uuid: 10784174762 you.com is built on azure, using data bricks for analysis, plotting and dashboarding, Kubernetes for deployment and PyTorch for machine learning. They are currently in the process of figuring out nvidia triton for model serving."}
{"prompt": "Who does the deployment of models in you.com?", "completion": "uuid: 10784174762 Deployment is mostly managed by ML Ops and DevOps people, with some back end engineers. An ML engineer may also do the deployment themselves, after having learned the pattern."}
{"prompt": "Can you explain briefly what Truefoundry does?", "completion": "uuid: 10784174762 Truefoundry is a path on top of Kubernetes designed to help ML developers deploy their models to production. It provides support for real time as well as batch case deployment of models, monitors resource utilization and costs, and allows for easy optimization of deployment for better cost efficiency."}
{"prompt": "What are some features of Truefoundry that make it user-friendly?", "completion": "uuid: 10784174762 Truefoundry enforces best practices and supports fast deployment through UI, CLI or Python. It supports traffic splitting and other complicated features by default and has a low learning curve."}
{"prompt": "What are the goals of Truefoundry?", "completion": "uuid: 10784174762 The goal of Truefoundry is to make deployment of machine learning models easy and efficient, enforce the best practices, ensure CI/CD, and enable developers to quickly deploy services through UI, CLI or Python."}
