{"prompt": "What are some of the challenges that Ankit and his team at locus are facing?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 Some of the challenges that Ankit and his team at locus are facing include improving geocoding as a problem, addressing transaction time at the door prediction, figuring out the premium pricing for the prime delivery slot, and possibly identifying the value-based pricing"}
{"prompt": "What is the data lake that Ankit and his team are using?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 Ankit mentioned that they currently use file storage S3 for the data lake since their load is currently not large enough, but they may explore other options like Snowflake in the future"}
{"prompt": "What is the team structure like at locus?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 Ankit has a team of roughly 7 data scientists, one or two data engineers, one data analyst, and a DevOps. The team collectively works on structure and non-structured data and leverages pre-trained models and libraries like PyTorch for development and experimentation."}
{"prompt": "What type of models is the team at locus currently experimenting with?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 The team at locus is currently experimenting with several machine learning models for different use cases, including optimization, geocoding, addressing transaction times and premium pricing for prime slots for delivery, but nothing has been put into production yet."}
{"prompt": "What do the experiments the team at Locus have in addressing the address problem?", "completion": "uuid: 12249609647 The Locus team has experimented with different approaches to NLP that specifically support address problems, either to train from scratch or to use pre-trained embeddings. They concluded that character-based embeddings tend to perform better than token-based embeddings because they preserve the punctuation and other significant characters in addresses."}
